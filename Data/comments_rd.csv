Again, the only reason private businesses exist is to make profits.  Whether the company is publicly owned or privately owned it makes no difference.  Koch Industries is one of the worst companies in the world and is privately owned.

Why do you think Advance Publications owns it now?  To make money is the answer.  The same reason they own all those TV channels and newspapers.

Public ownership might actually be better as users can now actually buy shares in the company and have some real control over the site.  Reddit has 430 million users, if everyone put up $20, they could control the whole company at the current valuation.

This logic is only valid if you’ve been continuing to buy at this current price. Have you?

Edit: You’re holding because you believe there’s a slight chance the stock might go back up and you can break even. If that’s your belief, wouldn’t it make sense to buy shares at only 50% of your cost basis, so that when it does go back up, you can actually profit?

Also another edit because I post my comments too early:

With this logic, your only other “choice” is to ride it to zero since you won’t sell for a loss. Essentially you’d rather lose everything you invested, or break even. Profiting off this investment is entirely off the table for you because you (probably) aren’t buying more shares at this current price to lower your cost basis",t3_rhr40s

What do Reddit users think about the Reddit IPO?

Reddit users on the forum r/WallStreetBets have already vocalised their concerns about the move to take the firm public. The main criticism seems to be that as a listed company, Reddit will need to start generating more income to please shareholders, which could result in users seeing more advertising and modifications to the experience.

How much is Reddit worth?

Reddit was valued at $10 billion in a private fundraising round in August 2021, but by the time of its IPO, the online message board company is aiming for a valuation of more than $15 billion.

What does Reddit do?

Reddit is an online discussion board and community, founded in 2005 by Steve Huffman and late activist Aaron Swartz. Despite not being as popular as other social media firms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, Reddit has made its name with niche – and often controversial – discussion groups.

Reddit has more than 100,000 communities, in which over 53 million active daily users share their thoughts and ideas on a range of topics. In fact, Reddit is currently the 19th-most-visited website on the internet, and the sixth-most-popular social networking site.

The site allows users to post anonymously, which is supposed to encourage honestly and transparency. Any post can be voted on by the community; posts with the largest number of up votes are viewed more and hold greater authority.

Most recently, Reddit has become a hub of retail investors, flocking to the board r/WallStreetBets to discuss tips and ideas on stock trading. The community – known as a subreddit – was responsible for the rise of GameStop and other so called ‘meme stocks’. Their intentions were to profit as hedge funds covered their short positions, in what’s known as a short squeeze.

How does Reddit make money?

Reddit makes its money through advertising on its site. It reported that in Q2 2021, it made $100 million in ad revenue – three times the amount it made in Q2 2020.

For users who don’t want ads on their feeds, there is a ‘premium membership’ available, which grants an ad-free experience as well as full access to the r/lounge, 700 free monthly coins, and other benefits. The membership costs $5.99 per month or $49.99 per year.

Reddit also generates money through Reddit Coins, which are virtual goods that Reddit users can purchase in bundles and gift to other Reddit users to reward them for their contributions and good content. Coin bundles cost between $1.99 to $199.99.

Other benefits to users holding Reddit Coins include access to the r/lounge. Which is an exclusive subreddit group for Premium members only.

Reddit has also raised capital through eight rounds of fundraising, generating a total of $919 million from 27 different institutional investors.

Is Reddit profitable?

No, Reddit isn’t yet profitable. In 2020, Reddit reported $170 million in revenue.

Learn how to read a company's earnings report.

What is Reddit's business strategy?

Reddit’s business strategy thus far is a pretty odd one, given that the firm sacrifices the opportunity to make money in order to keep its users happy. As we’ve seen, advertising space sales are the company’s primary revenue stream. However, Reddit does not require email addresses and does not track personal information, losing out on the opportunity to increase advertising through data exploitation, in order to keep its users anonymous.

And this is where one of the biggest challenges Reddit could face comes in: regulation. Due to the anonymity of users, there’s always the possibility of malpractice and manipulation, such as bots or even hedge funds driving users toward certain stocks. Reddit does already have moderators in place, but once it’s a public firm the level of scrutiny it’ll face will likely increase. Any thread to the anonymity of users could cause an exodus from the platform.

After half a decade neglecting its ad platform, Reddit has begun to invest heavily in this area before it goes public, so we may see the company reach profitability by 2022.

Reddit announced in 2020 that it was buying video creation app Dubsmash, entering into direct competition with TikTok.

The company also just hired its first ever chief financial officer, Drew Vollero (previous CFO for SNAP) in what many see as preparation for its IPO.

Who owns Reddit?

Reddit is owned by Condé Nast Publications, a global media company, who bought the company from founders Huffman and Ohanian one year after it was created for $10 to $20 million.

Current investors in Reddit also include Fidelity Investments, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Tencent Holdings.

Reddit can’t catch everything that quickly as subreddits pop up so things will squeak by until it’s not noted until much later. 

Another user mentioned Twitter didn’t ban porn, but I want to say that Reddit banning porn would be easier since they can just make the subreddit creation process harder and mass ban entire subreddits quite easily compared to Twitter and banning users.

1987,1987,1888,hp1pbon,t3_rj5cgx,"I think the real important thing with this IPO is to recognize that reddit exposure for reddit stock will probably create a surge in performance before the eventual downswing in stock Price. Just because logically the IPO may create censorship issues for the users does not mean people wont buy this IPO. So no matter how you feel about it i think it’s foolish to not make money on both ends of this trade. 

EXAMPLE : HOOD. Most reasonable people agree robinhood is a garbage brokerage , but we still know that tons of millenials use it and thus we saw a huge price surge for about 1 week after IPO. Didnt matter that it was a garbage company a bunch of autists still bought the stock. Hedgefunds probably also rode the wave and took advantage of the hype and then sold their shares near the top. I think we see a similar run to Robinhood. 

So in my opinion the move here is to Buy shares at IPO day, ride the wave, lock in gainz and then contemplate a short position or buying puts. Use the whole animal, make money on both sides of the trade.

But thats just my IMO",t3_rj5cgx

I also think fundamentally the value to shareholders of buying into an IPO is that you’re giving money to a company to invest in their platform or tech or advertising to increase sales/users/engagement. How would Reddit do these things with our money? How would our money increase future growth/revenue/profits? What technology or growth would investing in them bring? What are they going to do or change in the app and how would that make it add users or profits? Nothing. It’ll be like Twitter stock where a mature (age not content, per se) platform doesn’t show increased users, monetization, or profits.

SPAC's became the go to move for companies (both sketchy and legit) to get into this investor dogpile quickly since its faster than a full IPO.  Now, the market is less bullish and people are moving investments away to less risky stocks. The SPAC craze appears to be slowing also.  

Rivian was probably the last hurrah of the throw money at a tech IPO or SPAC, and everyone saw it tank pretty hard after a huge hype up to 170$

While Reddit isn't a super sketchy SPAC, it is still a risky tech IPO.  I think I'm gonna view this as a short term Pump and Dump strategy rather than a long term hold",t3_rj5cgx

Now it has become a lot more fluff, a lot more noobs, a lot more internal nonsense instead of just good old content. It was declining even before the redesign, but that definitely kicked more people off and then between everything that has happened in the last 5 years it has just devolved into more of a clusterfuck. This IPO will kill it since when has corporate money ever left shit alone, it is always how do we make more money?

————————————————————————

I think they just want to cash out while they can still guarantee a relatively high IPO. 

This is just my opinion, but the IPO market has been insane the past 2 years. Countless companies raising record capital and some being overvalued. I believe the cycle is winding down, and that this is their last chance to get a higher than normal IPO and cash out (at least for the short term). 

Not all of the data below directly relates to Reddit IPO, but they are all intertwined. When the equity market is frothy, SPACS popping off, crypto going bananas, etc, this allows companies to IPO higher. Markets dont like uncertainty. If Russia attacks Ukraine, and lets say threatens European countries to not intervine or they cut their oil/gas (this is all extremely speculative, just trying to create an example) this will have an impact on markets. Could amplify other macro events and markets go lower, then Reddit cannot raise as much at IPO. 

My reasoning:

-	S&P 500 is set to end higher this year for the third year in a row. Analysts predict a rally in 2022, but a four year streak has only happened 5 times in the past century
-	Fed announcing 3 rate hikes for 2022
-	Crypto/NFT mania seems to be cooling off
-	Winter season with Omnicron variant/covid/flu
-	S&P and Nasdaq are heavily weighted and being held up by a few tech giants. Look under the hood at all the other companies and their returns
-	2021 record year for IPOs and SPACs; see below
-	SPAC boom/bust: most SPACs are down since the boom in February. CLOV down 73% YTD, SPCE down 37.7% YTD, OPEN down 40% YTD, SOFI up 20%. ($2.45) YTD
-	Recent IPOs: Coinbase down 29% since IPO, Rivian down 25% since IPO, Bumble down 56% since IPO, Robinhood’s ath after their IPO was $85, is now trading $19.10, Oatly down 64% since IPO, Coursera down 47% since IPO, Lemonade (2020 IPO) down 59% YTD, Beyond (2019 IPO) down 52% YTD, Peloton (2019 IPO) down 71% YTD
-	2020 IPO Upstart Holdings up 216% YTD, but has been on a downtrend since hitting all time high in October. Past 3 months is down 54%. I call this out as an example of frothy, since the clip of someone pumping this on CNBC and couldn’t answer when asked what the company does
-	Oil/Gas issues. When oil went negative in 2020, some refineries and pumps were permanetly closed. CNBC and Bloomberg had oil people on who explained this. You cant just quickly reopen/restart them. US crude oil production is projected to return to 2019 levels in 2023. The amount of crude oil processed at US refineries is projected to return to 2019 levels by 2025. 

As I previously stated, this is all my opinion. I’m a complete amateur. I love this stuff and am trying to become a trader at a firm, but realistically I dont know anything and am probably wrong about a lot. I’ve been wrong countless times in 2020/21.",t3_rj5cgx

Just ask any small or medium size business owner about those unavoidable transaction fees that they have to pay; why do you think some gas stations have a minimum for credit/debit purchases? I wish OF was doing it for publicity.

2405,2405,2306,hp3283s,t1_hp2y5ba,"Fun fact, OF doesn’t plant those stories. It’s just media frenzy over sex work and Celebrities popularizing the platform. I know quite a few people who have been in the “media” due to their Onlyfans and trust me, OF doesn’t arrange shit lol. In reality, OF SUCKS AS A PLATFORM. There’s way better platform but they all have low traffic. Like there’s no internal promoting system. It’s not like PH where channels are recommended, all the advertising is done by the creator themselves. It’s just the largest platform since celebrities are hosted on there. Most of the top creators on Onlyfans are celebrities and influencers that do not show nudity, OF would have capitalized on that and followed through similar to how Patreon did. Also, Onlyfans lost a huge chunk of paying users leave the platform due to its volatility, and that was predictable. So what does OF get out of that story except losing revenue? And OF is notorious for taking money from creators without a trace, shutting down legitimate pages and so many problems. Many of you all don’t talk to OF girls or sex workers, so there’s a lot of false narrative out there that don’t even make sense when critical thought is applied. And it’s exactly how the religious right wants it to be, so ppl like you, spew misinformation that frames the issue as “Onlyfans bad” instead of realizing that the religious right is censoring your internet content. 

FYI: MasterCard changed their vendor rules in October due to SESTA FOSTA. Onlyfans payment processor changed to ccbill in November, with this change came numerous crackdowns on content, and major content policies updated restricting BDSM content and certain 3rd party content to adhere to their new payment processor rules. Idk about you but it definitely sounds like they planned to get rid of explicit content, saw the backlash, CCBill likely struck a good deal with them, and they reversed their decision.",t3_rj5cgx
2406,2406,2307,hp4bskv,t1_hp46ih8,"You’re mistaken, they originally were going to get rid of all explicit content including penetration, masturbation, or and hardcore acts. When they reversed, their new processor and guidelines of MasterCard is what caused them to get stricter on CNC. Their initial decision was to only allow soft core porn, very similar to what happened to Patreon as they used to allow hardcore stuff on there way back but their payment processor (PayPal) did not want explicit content. OF’s payment processor literally changed in November. Hence why you can now purchase a subscription without “Onlyfans” showing on the statement it is now CCBill, which has stricter guidelines for the sexual content they will process payments for. That’s why kink stuff got restricted. Not because they weren’t planning on banning porn. They very much were planning on banning hardcore stuff, the email they sent is literally all over Twitter. And the amount of users they lost in that time would be antithetical to any subscription based website’s agenda. 

Reddit probably won’t ban porn, I assume they will do what Twitter does and “shadowban” adult content creators from their search bars, and restrict NSFW subreddits from purchasing awards to make sure they aren’t violating SESTA FOSTA. Similar to how sex workers can’t monetize their accounts on Twitter. The current SESTA FOSTA lawsuit against Reddit is actually garbage, but that still means Reddit is on their radar and them going public makes it 10x easier to stir up commotion and scare investors without having to do a lawsuit. There’s lots of stuff going on there.",t3_rj5cgx

As for « genuinely violent » again depends what you’re referring to, but there were some dissident political subs or even non-political but made comments admins didn’t like that got nuked. 

Reddit used to be a very free speech place, everyone understood that there were subs you didn’t like on the site but that doesn’t mean you take them down, it means you just don’t visit there. Even just having an axe dangling over the head of any subreddit that wants to touch certain topics changes the culture. 

Reddit made an effort to become more palatable to the average user, and in doing so invited the staleness and « safety » that the rest of social media suffers from. 

Even just making it possible for people like that to remain here makes subreddits like r/againsthatesubreddits possible where mods don’t even need to hate a sub to axe it, because those users can just report or false flag any sub out of existence. 

Old users will remember the reaction to the banning of r/fph or r/coontown, people weren’t huge fans of those subs but everyone understood how serious a precedent it was. Now subs getting banned is just part of how the website works, that was unthinkable 10 years ago.

Now unfortunately for us, advertisers also know this science - and they know that we don't have a conscious way to control what our brain learns - and they decided to use this knowledge to make life suckier for the rest of us by making more and more effective ads, tailored to get inside our brains and minds and stay there.

The reason companies pay for ads at the end of a video, or to rerun a shortened ad just a few mins after running a full ad, is because it's a very effective way to make your brain ""learn"" the ad.

(If you ever wondered why kids seems to have such an easier time learning about brands and products than learning say math or history, the sad fact is that the ad firms have a way better grasp of both the science and the practical parts of learning than most teachers - granted, they also have far more resources and incentives, but still...)",t3_rii7x8

Everything that happens after an IPO is in the interest of making as much money as possible for shareholders. Reddit, on the other hand, is about authenticity. It's where you go if you want to talk to (mostly) real people. Monetization is the antithesis of authenticity. When you start trying to make money off something, you fundamentally take away it's authenticity. Look at the news media for a good example...its continued push toward monetization has corrupted it on a deeper level than most ever thought possible. What I'm getting at is that Reddit+IPO is like oil+water, baking soda+vinegar, matter+antimatter. They cannot coexist in the same place. The IPO of Reddit will be the beginning of the end of Reddit.

A good example of a company that didn’t focus on monetization as much as they “should” have after IPO was Twitter. Dorsey kept it authentic-ish compared to what he could have done. Now that he’s out and it has “moved on from its founders”, I imagine TWTR earnings results are going to go up and up",t3_rqvwxm
3769,3769,3670,hqhv8uw,t1_hqer9da,">Everything that happens after an IPO is in the interest of making as much money as possible for shareholders.

Not exactly.  The markets intent is also to provide a source of funding for the companies AFTER IPO.  That's why it's in the companies best interest to continue being as attractive to potential share holders as possible to keep the price inflated in case they ever need to raise capital by issuing additional equity.  This is especially true for most companies shortly after IPO in the ramp up growth (S curve in manufacturing).  For example, watch Rivian issue shares in the 2nd quarter.

While I agree that it's difficult for many companies to go public when doing so seems the antithesis of core mission since shareholders want profits first, it's not impossible.  Especially with a new bread of share holders with a focus on ESG.  

But totally agree that ""going public"" can ruin the nature of some companies. For example, my business buys product from a company that just went public last year.  They offer a remote maintenance cloud management product my business had come to rely on.  They offer the software to dealers for free that buy their hardware.  We in turn offer our clients support and maintenance packages for monthly reoccurring revenue.   I know they are going to start charging us for it now that they are public.  As a shareholder, I want them to.  As a dealer, I'll cuss them to high hell if they do without adding benefit.",t3_rqvwxm

I thought… what a d***! 

Then I came to find out that the employee had been out drinking and came upon this homeless dude sleeping inside a sleeping bag on the sidewalk. So the employee decides to start pissing on this homeless dude while he’s sleeping. I guess the dude woke up, heard this drunken guy yelling at him only to unzip the sleeping bag and finds himself getting pissed on.  I was told that the cops did not charge him. 

Don’t know why that came to mind….. oh maybe cuz supposedly it was someone higher up at Reddit.

I would agree with this if mods were extremely neutral, dry, and professional.

Generally, reddit mods don't try to be any of these things.

It's a symbiotic relationship. Mods keep reddit clean for advertisers, and in return get the authority to behave in silly ways. I had a friend who argued with a power mod and was instantly banned from about 150 different subs. Or remember when the old /r/wallstreebets mods came back and hastily attempted to monetize the subreddit? Or remember the big dispute between the reddit admins and power mods over covid-19 discussions?

They're not held to the standards of employees. Really, this is a hobby for them rather than a job. If we started charging them money to continue moderating, they'd pay it. Market it as a $10.00 per month subscription to ""Reddit Premium"".

This sub is actually a great example of the impact of mods. It used to be ""4chan found Bloomberg terminal"". I think you'd be instantly banned for behaving like that now. Now it's more like ""the living embodiment of soijack googled the term 'hedgefund'"".

There is a decent chance I'll be banned for this comment alone, because it's within the prerogative of mods to ban people on whims. It's the price we pay for free moderation.",t3_rmc8rx

Instead of Reddit choosing who gets paid ‘x’ amount for ‘y’ work, the users who purchase premium etc have the ability to Reward or “Moon” users who they feel deserve it. So no, people are not guaranteed to be paid for their “Community Service” 😉 but in a sense that income is reliant on the other users who value ‘y’ service for ‘x’ amount. 

In order to pay mods, Reddit would need very reliable data processes in order to prevent fraudulent payouts for mods just gandering on the app without putting forth a service for the community for a certain alotted time. Would also need to implement qualifications for communities to be monetized otherwise you could theoretically just make your own communities and get paid for all the time you spend on the app interacting with extracurriculars you would be enjoying anyways..",t3_rmc8rx

Everything goes through Cloudflare, AWS and/or Azure now. If the powers want something shut down, it gets shut down. 

Reddit is a containment area. They can keep the conversation centralized, filtered, and marginalized. When they decide they have marginalized the conversation enough, it gets “quarantined” for dubious reasons, forcing users to migrate to another platform that they call out on the sub. That platform will be hosted using compromised infrastructure, and when the plug gets pulled on Reddit, it will get pulled on that fallback platform as well.

Now, according to that, we should be in the 10-15 mil. registered shares range which would represent 17-25% of a 60 mil float.

In this way, I think their 'you can't sell out of Computershare' FUD is now working against them.

Also, I'm sure during MOASS reddit will either be down, or will ban/restrict these subs. If we have an independent alternative, we are in a far better position.",t3_rk1ti6
5571,5571,100,hp7cik8,t1_hp7ayeh,"If the price goes up, even nominally, people will be excited and less people will be motivated to DRS. It’s just psychology. 

At some point new DRS will be cancelled out by hold DRS holders selling- for example if there are 10 M drs shares, and we are adding 1000 a day, at some point those 10 M may sell more than 1000, meaning the net DRS will shrink. These ideas are the basis why I don’t see us going past 20%.

Now, I don’t trust brokers, so DRS is important, but it won’t go to 100%.",t3_rk1ti6

I’ve certainly seen, and been involved in, the board making recommendations, even demands if you will but that did not mean company did them. My concern in all of this is everyday it’s something yet everyday nothing happens. It will happen when it happens but so far we are batting a fat zero. So before anyone starts going down potential rabbit holes I think it’s fair to challenge. I don’t know everything so maybe there is a risk but my experience tells me there isn’t.

Also a crap ton of discord channels.",t3_rk1ti6
5584,5584,113,hp8gtzh,t1_hp7v23c,"I doubt they actually want to do this. It would unleash ""the Napster effect"". They kill off the one site where practically all of the bad shit is happening. Then those 500k people who are following GME threads on reddit move to 150 different other places. Their opportunities for manipulation becomes impossible to manage and they will also need that many more people to follow the development on those sites. Remember that all of the reddit posts are freely available and centered in one place. We know they have people following what happens here. Hell the reddit crowd probably gave them several ideas for how to act in the past months by discussing what we thought they were going to do. They could just pick the best ideas presented here.",t3_rk1ti6
5585,5585,114,hp7zfnq,t1_hp7st3r,"DRS is an acronym for direct registration of shares. This means that the shares are being directly registered to your name in GameStop’s shareholder registry.

This is different from a broker because what you’re really holding with a broker is a contract that entitles you to the rights of a share but you’re not actually an owner of the share. You’re considered a “beneficial owner” with this arrangement and I’m no lawyer but it seems to mean they can legally do whatever the fuck they want with assets you thought you owned.

Do your own research. I highly encourage it because I think once you do you’ll see that it’s the only way. We might as well be placing our shares under Ryan cohens bed.",t3_rk1ti6

5591,5591,120,hp7p57c,t1_hp7oevc,"Yeah I don’t think we’re fucked if Reddit goes down, replied with this to someone else earlier but hope this clarifies what I was going for: 

I don't think not having Reddit would take us down but it's definitely our biggest weapon. No doubt we would find some alternative platform, but it would probably have a fraction of the users, interaction, and reach.

There might be enough people continuing to DRS/buy through Computershare to get there anyway, but it would definitely take longer and I don't want to give them more time to figure out creative new ways to fuck us.",t3_rk1ti6
5592,5592,121,hp85azq,t1_hp83009,"Sure. I’m not familiar with Reddit’s org chart or how decision making works there necessarily, but I do know that people bringing in the money typically make the rules.

The situation I’m picturing is that Reddit goes public, then some shf (or group of SHFs) buy 15-20% of the company and start telling Reddit’s board that “conspiracy theory” subs like gme and superstonk are a bad look for advertisers and regulators and that they should treat us like qanon. All of a sudden we’re restricted, then we’re banned. Not that crazy IMO.",t3_rk1ti6

It would also help the overall market and he could be ""persuaded"" to relieve some stress. It may not be enough if the shorting is really bad, like say 250% SI but RC can both get rich and then come back in when the stock price normalizes. I know folks might day he could be tagged for ""manipulation"" but I don't see that happening. Isn't his two year lock up period expiring eary next year?

Suddenly you start hearing people say that GME is compromised and everyone needs to move to sub “X” (fear). 

A bunch of people move to the new sub and others see it as some kind of exodus, suddenly there are two subs, which one is the “correct” one (uncertainty). 

Multiple voices in the new sub start commenting on the veracity of the previous sub and likewise people from the previous sub do the same (doubt). 

Only people it benefits? People who want to spread FUD. 

The reason that other sub went down is because it was a clown show filled with people spreading patently false information and dealing in casual racism and nationalism to the point where they broke multiple  terms and conditions that Reddit users are supposed to abide by.

Just a few weeks ago, I went to buy hamburger at my local supermarket.  We were going to make chili that day.  They didn't have any.  None.  

I was rather shocked, because in my 50+ years I can never remember a supermarket being out of ground beef.  \*EVER\*.  

They plenty of it the next day, but it was still a bit of a wakeup call.  No, it's not like bread lines in the old Soviet Union or during the Great Depression here in the US, but for those used to having several different options for a common food item, finding it out of stock when there isn't an impending snowstorm or the like was a bit of a shock.

The sucess of a platform is not the compute, it's the idea, the development, the promotion, the investment. That will always be centralised because all projects need management. Look at Linux or any open source project. Totally free for anyone to make their own but the kernel is controlled by a select few, and distutions are run by a small number of companies. Sure, there are lots of distros but the popular ones have management, investment, and business plans. Ie centralised. The others are hobby projects,  unsuccessful. 

Bitcoin *alone* is estimated to be using 13GW of power (today, 2021-12-17 @ 18:25 GMT). To put that into context the entirety of the UK demand (which will include some bitcoin power) is 43GW right now during peak demand as everyone cooks dinner in the dark winter nights. So equivalent to 30% of a highly developed nation's peak power needs. Add in other cryptos and you rapidly exceed the power demands of entire counties. Web 3.0 would massively expand energy demands. Do you *really* think that is a good use of energy, or do you think some other mechanism could be found?

Oh, one last thing. Don't forget that the powers given above are end user powers and don't include the inefficiency of generation and distribution. Take a low carbon modern nuclear power plant like Hinkley C. It will generate about 3.2GWe, but it will piss away 6GW of heat into the sea. Closed cycle gas turbines are better. A 3.2GWe plant would chuck about 2.2GW into the atmosphere. What about renewable? Well, in 2020 the UK produced 75TWh of wind energy from 11,000 wind turbines. The UK is the best place in Europe for wind power and one of the best in the world. In that year bitcoin alone consumed 113TWh, or equivalent to 16,500 wind turbines.",t3_riis0e

I don't know what members here are picturing when someone says ""Reddit"", but I think they would be pleasantly surprised to see it's pretty much just like it is here.

While it means different things to different people, the 'Bogleheads' (or: passive indexing) approach to investing is all about low-cost, tax-efficient, broadly diversified, long-term simplicity. This philosophy is about making a plan for the long haul and sticking with your strategy through times of fear or irrational exuberance. Set and forget your nest egg, tune out the noise; buy, hold and rebalance; get outside, enjoy life!""*

But if you have a specific question or fear, ask it here or at Bogleheads.org.   It’s true that maximum capital appreciation can be attained by holding 100 percent equities.  It’s also true that the younger you are you should hold more equities.  But, as you get older and depending on the size of your resources compared to your actual needs and ones risk tolerance levels, bonds could play a very useful role.  It’s one thing to have $20 million in equities when you only have an annual need for $100,000, it’s something totally different when you have $2 million and you need $100,000.

The fiduciary obligation of a company to its shareholders includes endeavoring to profit. It doesn’t consider the health of the community or well being of its product end user or any other externality / community stakeholder except to the extent it is calculated to make them look bad in the public view (and sometimes- only sometimes to the extent to which it’s required to by law / regulation / the EPA). 

All the more problematic when you have one party actively trying to tear down regulation so they can have a runaway growth engine, even if it kills people and permanently damages communities. If corps didn’t at least endeavor to profit, the board would be ousted. 

It’s been a problem for decades and is the reason why you see corporations doing things like dumping toxic effluent into rivers and killing people downstream while literally paying millions a day in fees to the EPA and then paying out class action suits for rare cancers (Dow, BASF, Exxon, pretty much all of cancer alley, and that’s just a single example). They employ teams of accountants to protect their bottom line / shareholder value and they factor in the cost of the legal fight for causing harm. 

While this is a dramatic example since not every corp is manufacturing something that creates toxic waste products, without adequate regulation we can’t expect publicly traded corps to behave as good-faith contributors to the community. They will only do as much to save face / give back as they feel maximizes their bottom line, to the detriment of the lowest paid workers, people in communities where these monsters pollute-for-profits, etc.

Do I still “sound like a Trumper”? TF out of here. Go back to Wallstreet Bets and encourage people there to try and blow up the IPO so you can profit, to the detriment of the Reddit community.",t3_rhkj2w

Reddit has been very supportive of r/antiwork and we have maintained good communication with the admins.  We have even been given access to certain tools and features not made available to other subreddits.  We have no reason to believe at this time that the announcement of a forthcoming IPO will lead to major changes in Reddit policy or to any sort of activist shareholder(s) engaging in conspiratorial plots to have this subreddit or other leftist subreddits shut down.

Most of the subreddits that have been banned have been banned either due to being unmoderated, or for persistent, pervasive, unmoderated violations of the Reddit Rules.  We have consistently taken steps to abide by the Reddit Rules, to the best of our interpretation.  If the admins point out to us that we need to take further action to abide by sitewide rules, we will take appropriate action.

We do not need a massive panic to making alternative servers or trying to jump ship from the subreddit.  While we are floored by the fact that so many of you are eager to make contingency plans, the moderators here want to ensure you that we do not foresee any forthcoming subreddit ban or other adverse action taken against the subreddit.

There is quite literally no point to listening to what the admins will say in statements. 

Because the reality is they have no idea.  Every single acquisition begins with the promise that the IP being sold will retain its independence.  The rank and file will be told whatever they need to be told so that they can push the message downstream and keep everything peaceful and stable prior to the IPO.  They'll lie, knowingly or unknowingly, for no other reason than because great sums of money are at stake.

But once the chains are in place, the changes begin insidiously and persistently.  And no one at the company has any power to change that, even if they wanted to.

Large and powerful labor organizations are ""bad"" for ""business"".  And when a company IPOs, ""business"" is literally the *only* thing that matters.

In order to make regular bank, ACCEPTABLE BANK, to the lowest common denominator investor holding Reddit shares in the future, ANYTHING CONTROVERSIAL or potentially affecting the site's ability to make money in any shape or form will be ruthlessly sanitised to the point of nonexistence. 

Reddit started out as a subversive social media site. Going utterly mainstream by going public with an IPO will just make it lose everything that attracted people to come on this site to begin with. No new users, crashing existing user numbers, bad for business, bad for this site.",t3_rp4hcn

Du hast deine Gefühle für dich behalten. 

Du hast mit niemandem darüber geredet. 

Du hast abends im Bett geweint und daraufhin eine Entscheidung getroffen. 

Alle, macht das nicht. Redet mit irgendjemandem über eure Gefühle und was das mit euch macht. Schreibt einem User, dem ihr vertraut, einer Omi oder dem modteam, wenn ihr keinen kennt. Egal, ob ihr getrollt oder beleidigt wurdet, ob ihr euch unerwünscht fühlt, selbst wenn ihr 🌈 🐻 seid, ob ihr gerade 100.000€ verzockt habt, ob ihr gerade auf den neuesten Meme-Pump and Dump reingefallen seid, selbst wenn ihr nur 100€ verloren habt, die euch aber sehr wichtig waren - wenn es euch mehr mitnimmt, als es sollte, redet mit irgendjemandem, vor allem, bevor ihr dumme Entscheidungen trefft.

This led it to an address belonging to ""Individual X"", who is alleged to have hacked the funds from the marketplace.
Law enforcement officers in turn took control of the sum on 3 November, and the DoJ claims the funds are now subject to forfeiture.

If it's reddit as a whole you're talking about, then there's already a replacement, if forget the name, but it exists already.

There's always running a darkweb forum, and plenty of open source forum like implementations to operate a public discussion forum. Get funding for some servers if you wish to recreate the sub elsewhere, I don't know what it would take based off of not knowing the amount of users (and ddos) attacks you'd have to mitigate...but cloudfare provide services for such things at a cost.

Tbh, I wouldn't join any such forum from a poster I don't know, I hope your heart is in the right place, but I'd much happier bring this to the current mods to implement...and that's where the (a) blockchain comes in...""our bill is x this month, once the wallet reflects that amount stop contributing"".

I get your heart is in the right place, but you're creating problems and issues to those who are in tech...specifically infrastructure like I am...I'm not saying I have the answers, but I can say is I would absolutely not fund your software development of recreating the wheel...best thing about my idea, there's a ton of open information on how to do it, and all it costs is hosting money, not development money...the transfer user statistics can also easily be done with mod controls, hell, a script so some poor sod doesn't have to verify each user account, and even then, doing it manually wouldn't be hard, time consuming for a few people yes, but not hard.

I am still working on it, I have decided to remove 50% of the features and retain basic features. Enough for communities to be built, filled up and conversate. **I can release it anytime, should be able to handle** ***<1 Million users***.

A blockchain social network is same as user-data being replicated over multiple servers spread across regions. It still retains control the single owner(the company). This is basically what my platform is.

Is it a terrible choice? in the long run YES, but in the beginning we have a better user experience and in the future there will be a chance for another startup to out-do the bloated company who decided to stop listening to the userbase OR when they start to mass-censor topics, users and conversations.

I want to be honest up-front about the present, future and If you want to know about the past. I am all ears.  


edit: Obviously it will be expensive burn rate(FOR ME) to run the servers. But if you like the platform, I can set up donations through patreon, or something else. Until I release subscriptions or payments(monetization). There is no plan for Ads at all. I definitely do not want to sell my gme shares.

The best thing would be, if a small group of users want to use it first so I can see how the platform scales, this way I can also support the server bills by-myself.",t3_rk1hv9

- random screaming and anxiety at new and useful technologies

Before writing something from scratch, look at a load of open source projects that do parts of what you need, like: https://github.com/teddit-net/teddit. But there are loads more to research.

  


Second, you'd be surprised by the amount of non-core code that is need to maintain a successful business. In most business 20% of the code is customer facing, the rest is admin screens, analytics, monitoring, log analysis, notifications, security alerts, and more boring stuff. Ideally get a business analyst that has experience of social web sites and the different projects that are needed.

  


Third, it needs to be self sustainable. Cloud hosting costs money and it mounts uo very quickly. MOASS profits will be huge, but the hosting costs will burn through that money and give you a 6-12 startup runway if the site becomes successful. Thinking about some kind of revenue stream is important, maybe adverts but you don't want to be dependent on FAANG monopolies (including Cloud hosting) what happens if AWS turns off the taps on hosting?

  


The cheapest way to scale is with Kubernetes and data stored on Cloud native database, like Cassandra or DynamoDB. Don't use MongoDB or MySQL, it won't scale after you hit huge user numbers.

  


If I were designing a new Reddit, I'd bring it back to basics. Fuck UI design and make it fast and mainly text. You can add bells and whistles in the mobile apps and a separate team doing frontend UIs.

  


You'll need a fair bit of code time to give tools to Mods. They are the user stories that give Reddit it's uniqueness. UX wise it seems trivial, but there is a LOT of logic in that part of Reddit

You need to build it as a FOR PROFIT

and ensure everyone contributing gets paid

******************

Get a team together based on who are contributing

Then do a ICO or some other way of funding it

And build something that generates revenue, not something you hope will get donations etc

There are lots of ways to make money without advertising and without selling data

************************

Also, don't over think it

You can do something very serviceable with a team of

1 software dev

1 blockchain dev

1 graphic designer

1 program manager

1 tester

5 peopl3e is enough

heck, even one is enough if you get a superstar

As for the problem of coordinated attack, we would need a way to authenticate that new nodes coming online are legit, I think the concept of PoS and some form of proof that the node is owned by an actual ape could help.

If we do a proof of stake consensus mechanism, how would we distribute these coins fairly and trust that apes own the vast majority of these coins to trust the consensus mechanism.

I guess my question is...how does one view an NFT if they don't own it?

Not trying to start anything against NFT, I'm genuinely curious since ownership implies that you have control over it.",t3_rsbyv7
7794,7794,787,hqn851c,t1_hqlhz57,"I'm not really sure all that is necessary.  Hedge funds or the stock market don't own the DD's, and they are copyrighted materials just by virtue of being published.  The authors may not have intended to ever have to think on it beyond it's initial posting, but others can't technically just come and remove it from places they have no influence over.  Yes, technically, they could remove it from reddit, but I feel they know that would be pointless, and just paint reddit in a bad light, so what's the point since it would just draw attention to it, and censorship issues such as these tend to gain a lot of traction on social media.

I have a feeling with how big this all is, it'd just blow up in their faces if they tried.

I could potentially see them trying to take down the sub, but I don't think it'll be IPO one day, a few days later, SuperStonk and other GME related subs are suddenly banned.  It'd take time to get to that point, and likely other signs would exist that they were going to attempt such a move.

I think people are worrying too much about all this IPO stuff.  Some are certainly already presenting the worst case scenario as if it's a done deal.

But to me, if wall street wants to buy out reddit, it's for the same reason they buy out other media franchises.  To control what they want to push for their own gains.  GME itself is pretty much already going to screw them.  Disrupting the community isn't going to save them.",t3_rsbyv7
7795,7795,788,hqn9faw,t1_hqm3tbo,"Yeah.  Reddit had investors, and at some point those investors are going to want to cash in.  Reddit is hot right now, so it's a good time to cash in.

Market players may try to capture a significant portion of those shares, but my guess it's not to squash GME talk, but to have a ready supply of ignorant investors to peddle their P&D's too, and control their narratives as they see fit.  Same reason they buy up any other media outlet.

Worth remembering that the entirety of market players aren't all against GME.  Some are greedy in general and see the potential that reddit holds for them regardless of the current risk.  GME's squeeze will come, then go, and even if it stays high, those that stick around are going to have their sites on the future.",t3_rsbyv7

7806,7806,799,hqn6xeh,t1_hqlgrfh,"OK.

Gonna stop this FUD right now.  Amazon isn't going to go and take a bribe from wall street and delete any and all copies of any DD that may exist on any clients account.  Amazon doing so would cost them a hell of a lot more than they'd gain from anything that wall street would be willing to put up.  This would kill the idea that the cloud is a safe place for a company to keep their content, and would basically be handing the reigns to other players, such as MS, or open source cloud projects, or completely shatter any trust that companies have for cloud in the first place.

Data security is a big thing for these providers, and if this data gets taken down, it'll have to be targeted at individual clients through other means, and wouldn't require participation by Amazon or other players.

Beyond that, there is a lot of data redundancy on the internet.  Even the things google censors, many of which have been reported, are still able to be found on google servers.  Hell, old reddit posts can still be perused through offsite cache sites which are in no way part of reddit, and not purged just because a comment is deleted.

Overall, people are worrying way too much about this reddit IPO.  Reddit is valued high right now, partly due to what's happened with GME this year.  Reddit had investors early on, and those investors are going to want a return on their investment.  Reddit was going to IPO at some point, and there is no reason to believe that this IPO is some subversive way for reddit to somehow quell the rebellion.

People need to relax and think more broadly about this, and stop assuming any and everything is related to GME.

If you're really worried about the DD, download it all, rename it, put it into an encrypted zip file, and put it on a bunch of free servers all over the internet.  Pass it around to friends to hold on their computers, or put it on some USB drives.  If it gets taken down, there are likely thousands among the millions that have a backup of it somewhere.",t3_rsbyv7

- I guess this also means that Conde Nast Publications / Advanced Publications have lost money or otherwise they have been financially punished or threatened with relation to Reddit.

- So then the censorship that Fidelity does in the fidelityinvestments subreddit, those censorship humans will censor the fuck out of the entire site far more bullyingly and totalitarianly, oppressively,tyranically, stockholm syndromely than already

- Fidelity [showed their true colors](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rd10yg/fidelitys_november_2021_glitches_fuck_up/) and now Fidelity is gonna fuck up Reddit along with combined forces of other financial terrorists

- Who is the CEO? spez

- November, 2016, a redditor posted evidence indicating that Reddit administrators had modified multiple user comments. Following this post Huffman took responsibility for the comment modifications, writing that “Our community team is pretty pissed at me, so I most assuredly won’t do this again.”

- spez, remember that Aaron Swartz was either murdered/killed and framed as a suicide, or even if he was not murdered and that Aaron Swartz,as brilliant as he was, that his brain concluded that he must commit suicide as a solution, that if Aaron Swartz's brain was that smart to no longer be alive (again, even if he was murdered and propagandishly framed as a suicide by financial terrorist hired hitmen, or fbi, domestic terrorists, etcetera), that the position any human is in to survive and stand up against the corruption, it requires a lot of willpower.",t3_rhzvdm

7886,7886,879,hos1zp1,t3_rhqfkd,"Not completely on topic, but an idea in the event that Reddit *does* drop: Get the DD onto the ETH blockchain. Mint all the DD articles as NFTs, code the contracts to enable access via a fungible token (if that's a thing?), send each NFT to an inaccessible wallet so it can't be bought or sold by anybody, and spread the FTs far and wide across the internet. Free access to research articles that can literally never be taken down as long as Ethereum exists, and remain accessible to everyone as long as at least one access token continues to exist - and every access topken can be duplicated to allow access to new readers.

I am *not* an authority on crypto by any means, and I don't know whether or not this is actually possible/viable. But if it is, I think it would be a good way to effectively immortalise the DD in the event that Reddit drops, and/or the whole ""cyber pandemic"" event MSM has been telegraphing for the last few years hits before or during MOASS and wipes them off the internet. I know apes have been backing up the DD off the net as well, which is excellent in its own right.

If Reddit were to come together as individuals and all individually buy shares at the IPO and DRS them, all of this goes away once the apes here own Reddit outright.

Retail owns Gamestop.  The media says this is not so, but they are lying.  Retail has more power than they know.  Even after a year of empowerment and now watching hedgies fall almost daily, still doesn't even get it.  They have the power to move markets and change the world already.

But they're waiting for some miserable end instead?  Asking ""where do we go?""  Why not just stay, buy all the shares and DRS them, problem solved in the most F U way you can.  Take the FUD and turn it into your advantage, buy shares cheaper and DRS them en masse, all this goes away.  No need for an alternative when you literally own the company and all it's shares and never relinquish them to corporate vested interest.

But nobody even mentions this solution or talks about it so in my mind, it's doomed to go another way.  People just beaten down so hard they automatically give up not realizing they had all the power, they were just led to believe otherwise.

Apes here should know better, after this whole year.  The answer is evident.  Buy it, DRS it, own it.  Make the megacorp sweat and beat them at their own game!

From what I understand, it's going to be a place to buy and sell not only online purchases but also a new stock and crypto exchange backed by a block chain that records every transaction and even stock purchase just like ETH and BTC.  I could be wrong because of my smooth 🧠 though.
 

From Wikipedia:

""A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger (blockchain).[1] NFTs can be associated with reproducible digital files such as photos, videos, and audio. NFTs use a digital ledger to provide a public certificate of authenticity or proof of ownership, but it does not restrict the sharing or copying of the underlying digital file. The lack of interchangeability (fungibility) distinguishes NFTs from blockchain cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin.""

If I also understand, the new system LRC & Gamestop are putting together does not allow for copying the underlying file. An NFT should be completely secure.",t3_ri1dn3

is anyone interested in an Ape Wiki, to record the entirety of the ape & gme saga from our perspective?

I set up a generic mediawiki on a free hosting thing, and it's open to anyone. all the work and data put in, it's backed up in a single sql file, from which the wiki can always be recreated easily by anyone.

some lists & articles I started working on:

If there is no appointed leadership to shut down a sub that is, for example, doxing perceived enemies or organizing harassment campaigns, then could large groups of non-administrative users do it?  If they could, what's to stop troll farms for collapsing every unappealing sub within reach?  Or if there's no way to shut one down, then we have to be okay with letting abhorrent behavior go unchecked (e.g., communities designed to attract and groom children, bomb-making tutorials, echo-chambers for violent rhetoric against disadvantaged groups, etc.).

All that to say, I don't think we have a silver bullet for the problem yet, but I'm currently leaning more towards a leadership through a non-profit.

A great mind, who was persecuted for wanting to spread and make information free and available to all he could.  RIP.

In United States of America v. Aaron Swartz, Aaron Swartz, an American computer programmer, writer, political organizer and Internet activist, was prosecuted for multiple violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), after downloading academic journal articles through the MIT computer network from a source (JSTOR) for which he had an account as a Harvard research fellow. Facing trial and the possibility of imprisonment, Swartz committed suicide, and the case was consequently dismissed.[1][2][3]

Search him, he was an original founder of reddit, and also created ~~RRS~~ RSS feeds, that's all I can say, I'm sure he helped much more in other areas but it's been a while and I'm having a drink and wouldn't do it justice.

I remember being part of the pizza brigades where we would send pizzas to the admins anytime Reddit went down (which was a lot). We cheered him on when he advocated for trying to take concepts like wikipedia to the next level by freeing more knowledge from the privileged.

I saw other references state that videos where held on the JSTOR database, the same database that Aaron Swartz downloaded terabytes of information from, and apparently some of that was information on this satanic organisation along with actual CP....yeah...there's a world leading ring of satanic molesters out there with unlimited resources...who chose to hide all their incriminating evidence, on a JSTOR database.

Other places that came up on the search were Facebook groups ""investigating"" these things, as we are all aware, some of the greatest minds in modern history, are members of such groups, Facebook after all is a very fair, very neutral platform with stellar moderation...wait, don't they actively promote shit to viewers to get them riled up about things.

My scepticism is a direct reaction to people saying there's evidence without linking any evidence, but instead telling me to do my own research - no, if you present an argument it is not on me to prove it right or wrong, it is on them to present a case with supporting evidence, not get buthurt or angry when people sniger (actual spelling triggers automod) at the stereotypical behaviours they are displaying.",t3_ritzkk

But finding that middle ground on social media between decentralization (free speech) and moderation - that is a damn hard topic that exists almost as long as the Internet itself. In that area decentralization is not going to fix that, it may make things harder.

If, for example, posts are put on a blockchain, how will anyone remove harmful content? That ugly stuff - reporting it to authorities is not enough, it must go away.

They already have. Rpan, chat/dms, polls, reddit recap, etc are already inaccessible unless you're in the official app or on new reddit. 

An IPO will only cause more features to be dropped. My pessimistic guess though is reddit will shut down the public API and old reddit to force users onto their official app /new reddit if they do go public. Insane backlash on all platforms won't persuade the money from investors.",t3_rjqmdx

No, we didn't need the avatars, we didn't need the NFT avatars. No, we didn't need the ""decentralized"" blockchain bullshit. They're also, just like you said, adding new features only available in their shitty official app. I think RPAN was the last good thing they ever made (excluding awards (dude nobody cares about that sticker that cost you 5 bucks and gave some person 20 MeaninglessInternetPoints(tm)) and removing Aaron from the founders page), as RPAN at least had some original ""charm"" to it, this feeling of jank and it running on an old laptop held together with duct tape somewhere.

RPAN was sorta good. Not much going on there tho.",t3_rjqmdx
9552,9552,13,hpf1lu7,t1_hpenpry,"I am mostly offended at the way they pushed RPAN.

It's a totally separate product from reddit. If they had made a new website, linked it to your reddit account, shared it in /r/announcements, and advertised the hell out of it, I might have been intrigued.

But instead, they shoehorned it into reddit. There's a button up near the top of your reddit UI that pulls up a product that *just doesn't work like reddit*. It was shoehorned into everybody's feed, and it looked like a post or an ad, but it wasn't, and you couldn't vote on it, and you couldn't unsubscribe from it, it was just there. And they released it without an announcement explaining wtf it was. IDK what it is, at this point, all I know that it's not actually part of reddit, it's just stuffed in.",t3_rjqmdx
9553,9553,14,hpfncej,t1_hpf1lu7,"To be fair I have to agree, they did push it too hard. By the way, neither the button or the posts show up in the old UI.",t3_rjqmdx
9554,9554,15,hpfs0i3,t1_hpfncej,"I saw the posts for a while in the old UI. But it's kind of ridiculous that Reddit, by excluding bad features from the old UI / API, is actively selling me on them, and pushing me away from the new UI / official app. (I wasn't really considering the official app at any point).

9627,9627,1,hp0md4x,t3_riuusy,"Answer: Mostly, whenever a company goes public the assumption is they have achieved their primary goal, in case of reddit, setting up a giant dominant platform for forum on the internet. When they go public they will get investors and would focus primarily on generating profit for the shareholders. 

People think while doing this reddit would priotirize nuking ""controversial"" subreddits because they bring bad press to the product and investors won't like that. They would focus on monetization by adding more ads, maybe getting rid of third party apps in an effort to make reddit more closed and centralized (already started over the past couple years with profiles). The core reddit experience would be taken away for something which would just another social media company like Facebook. 

Something like piracy or NSFW  would be in far more danger now. The fear isn't completely unfounded.

EDIT: One important and obvious thing that I probably should have written clearly. Reddit already has investors like any other company. All giant companies have private investors and companies work towards generating profit. The new thing now is when reddit goes public retail investors like us will buy in as well and people fear that the things happening over the past few years (aggressive moderation in certain areas) will be doubled down. This doesn't mean reddit is suddenly go to remove all third party apps. End of an era. Jump ship. Nope. I'm just saying that is the general popular sentiment right now when the news broke.",t3_riuusy

9632,9632,6,hp14yb7,t3_riuusy,"Answer: While everyone is going on that investors want money - that's also true for the current owners. But I don't think they'll massively change the formula - it was always about making money from its users. ""You are the product"" is almost right, more specifically, you are the unpaid employee. The value of reddit is the content its users leave behind, which attracts more users, whose attention it can then monetize. If you mess around with that formula too much, too fast, the users will leave and you kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.

So no, I don't think you'll see any noticeable change in 1 year. But if I'd had to bet, my guess would be they'd go the way off twitter: Slowly kill off 3rd party apps, since those just show the content, without bringing in money through ads.",t3_riuusy

Look at Twitter and Facebook removing posts related to certain topics. Reddit is one of the few platforms that didn’t. Look at what Reddit achieved this year so far from an activism standpoint.

9637,9637,11,hoznh4m,t3_riuusy,"Answer: Going public means Reddit will be opening it's doors to public investors, and be listed on the stock market, so you, or I, or anyone else can become a shareholder of the company.

How will it effect us?

It probably won't effect the average user, other social media companies like Twitter, Snapchat and Facebook have already been listed on the stock market for years.",t3_riuusy
9638,9638,12,hp24vpp,t3_riuusy,"Answer: companies often want to raise money to do things like expand, enter new markers, develop new products, etc. There are two ways of doing that. The first is to take on debt. They take out a loan from a bank, or issue bonds, which they must pay back with interest. This is the only obligation when they take on debt; a lender can't tell them how to run the company, or what they can and can't do. All they can do is wait to be paid back.

But when it comes to borrowing, companies aren't all that different from individuals. Some are creditworthy, and some are not, and banks/bond buyers rate them accordingly, and charge higher or lower interest on their loans. A stable and profitable company can get a loan at a very low (cheap) interest rate, while a less well-established or struggling company will only be able to get a higher rate. This is bad, because high interest rates on loans eat into whatever gains they hoped to make by borrowing the money in the first place.

This is when companies look at the second way of raising capital, which is selling off ownership. Think of Shark Tank. An owner of a business agrees to give away equity, a percentage of ownership in the company, in exchange for cash. Unlike a loan, there is no fixed time or amount or any other requirement to pay that money back. However, an equity investor does have more rights than a lender. 

If a company runs at a profit, an equity investor who owns 20% of the company also is entitled to 20% of those earnings. The management of the company thus needs to distribute that money, OR use it to improve/grow. As a result, the company has a legal obligation to manage itself in the best interests of its owners, which gives investors some sway in dictating how the company conducts itself.

When a company ""goes public"", it means they are raising money by selling an ownership share of the company not just to a single investor/owner, but many investors, including the general public. They sell millions of very small shares to anyone who wants to own them. They buy them because they think the company will continue to improve, and therefore either pay out a share of the profit, or reinvest wisely and become more valuable.

Small shareholders, even those with just a tiny fraction of ownership, have all the same rights as large shareholders. Meaning they have sway in how the company is run in their best interests. Most people don't exercise those rights though, and instead delegate them to a proxy - such as the mutual fund they own that actually buys their shares, for example. Those groups are large enough to actually influence decisions that a company makes.

Sometimes the interests of those shareholders don't align well with the philosophy of a company's founders. Or their customers. They may cajole them into things like changing suppliers, or raising prices, or  shutting down underperforming products. By choosing to go public, and bring on new investors, the company had to weigh their need for debt-free cash against how much change and loss of control they were willing to put up with. 

In the case of reddit, they have decided to go public to raise new capital. They have previously raised cash from investors in private rounds, first from angel investors, then incubators, then silicon valley venture capital funds, and more recently large corporate investors (e.g. Tencent). Any of those owners can now sell on the open market to get their money (and probably more) back. If they decide to cash out, supply and demand says that when there's a lot of something for sale (e.g. shares) the price goes down. This is and for investors, so Reddit is obligated to keep their investors happy.

What is unknown is exactly what keeping them happy will mean in terms of concrete decisions about things that affect users. The frequency of ads? Moderating certain content? Who knows. The point is, if you previously, as a user, trusted the product vision of the company, there's now other cooks in the kitchen. One might be fearful that a thing they enjoy will change in a way they don't appreciate. Hence, all the hoopla.",t3_riuusy

Going public also raises money for the company.. in the order of billions of dollars potentially. A growth stock can be investing in new product lines and big new bets.  It doesn’t mean it will immediately start to show more ads, but it does mean that their books are public and so their profit and losses can be viewed by everyone.

9734,9734,108,hp2jlwr,t1_hp0zw7q,"Disagreed. Retaining old users isn’t necessarily important in the short-term as long as you manage to keep the total amount of users growing.

Reddit will likely become more and more sterilized akin to the larger social media platforms, which in turn will open up the gates for a competitor to rise that will eventually take over as the new “front page of the internet”. 

Moderating content vs. Letting the community run wild are opposing forces, and any growing social media platform will eventually run into the issue of sterilizing the community to continue growing (in order to please shareholders and gain mainstream appeal) or continue with business as usual. 

Unfortunately, most platforms choose the former (not 4chan though - hats off to Nishimura) which eventually leads to the platform decaying as the original users who made it great in the first place leave. Usually, the commercialization and newly introduced moderation will usually generate profits for a couple of years, until the platform either stagnates or withers away as another platform takes its place.

9775,9775,149,hp0oksv,t1_hozo7j5,"It isn’t like Reddit was a non-profit charity operation before going public. Reddit’s audience is very into adblockers, so adding more ads would not be a brilliant path to increased profitability.

I expect reddit will go public, and then declare they’re going to do something with NFTs, despite having no actual plan there. Investors looking to invest in NFTs, anticipating Bitcoin level profits, will invest in reddit as part of their hedged NFT investment portfolio. Reddit will pick all this invested capital up off the ground. People will realize Reddit NFTs are nothing a few years from now, but the savvy shareholders will cash out way before that.",t3_riuusy
9776,9776,150,hp0r5ru,t1_hozo7j5,"In theory, maybe. When going public a company has to establish a board of directors that look out for the investors. So a lot of what happens is going to come down to the board's current mandate and agenda. The company officers take much of their lead from the board.

As well when a company goes public there's more than one type of stock. But in this case the difference between voting and non-voting stock is what's important. A public company will have a share holder's meeting on a regular basis, usually yearly.

At this meeting shareholders with voting stock can vote on various issues the company is facing including replacing any and all board members. So even if we have board members that are Reddit community focused this can change, in a heart beat. While it's not a guarantee, any and all changes both good for the users and not will always be a possibility.

In the end due to the profit motive I see Reddit changing, possibly a lot. How long it will take and how disruptive the changes will be is anyone's guess. But it's been a good run, and if I have to jump ship? Well I was fine before Reddit and I'm sure I'll survive without it.",t3_riuusy

Going public isn't as dramatic as a buyout. 

When you get bought by another company you have new bosses and they have the power to almost immediately change all of your policies and tell you to GTFO if you don't like it. 

When you go public, now a group of people have voting rights and can periodically have meetings about the company's direction. In theory they can vote to dramatically change your policies or GTFO. Also in theory the /r/wallstreetbets people could buy out a majority stake and make SFW content illegal.

Reddit, you might be looking at some bot account that's farming up votes, or you might be looking at some very strange account that's definitely run by a human but with no way to really tell.

Tumblr wasn't either bud. But if 1 portion of the entire group migrates, it'll lower usage in other areas as well as a function of time 

It's a parasitic idea. If you remove 10% of the user base because of a lack of content that made them stay on reddit, the usage in other subreddits will drop and engagement will lower as well with less content and interaction. This is the parasitic quality in losing users

It's part of why other social media entities like tiktok/facebook/instagram/Twitter have engagement algorithms. Reddits algorithm is simple if you're a user. You see top posts from your pick of subreddits. If you lose some subreddits, you're losing engagement. Reddit, unless they change their intentions for ***new*** interaction on the website, can't combat losing a significant amount of users. In this case, a drop in a few percent could be pretty significant 


>and it would absolutely create a situation that invites a competitor, but I don't think it would devalue the company anywhere near the same scale it did Tumblr

But this is the entire thing I'm talking about. A small migration at first can be a huge one by the end of a decade once a competitor gets more attention

Reddit is a nicer place to speak one's mind on a subject and having thoughtful debates, people can disagree and we don't have to worry about whiny bitches strawmanning and generalizing a person's entire post history to get them banned, one really had to use actual ""hate speech"" before facing that, but within a handful of months of it going public, that'll change, it'll become a long winded version of twitter.",t3_rho3z0

Right, Facebook collects data, I don't dispute that. How they *use* that data is what's important.

>and stating that the raw data isn't sold directly is splitting hairs

The distinction is actually very important. Most people think that Facebook freely sells user data to other advertisers, which is bad in part because it carries certain privacy implications with it. That's a major reason that people dislike Facebook (and other big tech companies that run ads), and it's not even true.

>we didn't ask for these targeted ads

You asked for them by continuing to use free products and services. Gmail, YouTube, Google search, etc. are all free because of advertising. As unpopular as ads are, I think most people would greatly prefer them over the alternative, which is paying for everything out of pocket. ""YouTube Premium"" is practically a joke because no one wants to pay for it, but then everyone still complains about the ads. But you can't have it both ways.",t3_rho3z0

As for how long it takes to generate these posts -- I wont lie, but admittedly they do eat a good chunk of my morning's to compile and post here on Reddit. Typically about 30-45 minutes or thereabouts if I'm being honest lol. And yes, I write these up manually by hand. Of course, much of it is of copy & paste material, so it's not necessarily ""original content"" if you will. But, still, putting it all together into one thread and having it formatted in the way that looks legible enough on Reddit does take some work and eats time to be sure haha.

The Doge/SHIB comparison was not me comparing moons to meme coins. It was to portray a picture. Meme coin without a use case, whitepaper, or a legal entity behind it, banking only on Elon tweeting about it has a $25B mcap. If proper use case is developed for moons, when we get on the mainnet, with Reddit behind it, with the user base it has, I don't see why it could not reach that kind of mcap. Especially in the next bull run.

Even if we got 10 or 100 times that still wouldn’t be enough for even a board seat, let alone control. But the DAO could buy a non negligible amount with a stated goal of increasing their share until they have control. It’ll be interesting if this is ever attempted.

\- the fiat has to be moved to in a broker (although we should def use the transfer agent IMO)

11479,11479,1148,hq3be2d,t3_rp4fmx,"crypto is a service, not a product.

Remember how all of the tech stocks plummeted around the year 2000? Some of them rebounded a bit because there was a panic sell to preserve some of the investors assets (retirement accounts?).

Then, a few companies that actually still had customers had their stock value rebound to its historical average value.

I can name two that stood out. Ebay and AOL. The month after the panic-sell, millions of people were still auctioning and having ""sell now"" sales on ebay, and millions of people were still emailing and instant-chatting each other on AOL. They still got paid for posting ads, their core service was still being used by millions of customers, just as much as before the horrific economic ""correction"".

If crypto takes a dump, buy the dip my brothers. People in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Turkey will still be doing business buying stuff from China with crypto, and selling those items in their home country with crypto. Like El Salvador.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano are like having three different ""paypals"" that are trusted, and people using their SERVICE to perform a function. There are issues, but crypto has an even brighter future, because there is competition to prove that your crypto is better in some way, and they are improving every day. 

Security, low fees, ease of use, etc...

After the first of the year, I will sell the crypto I have on paypal, but...that was the first crypto I bought, because I unexpectedly saw that I could now buy crypto on paypal, and all it took was three clicks.

I have since moved on to other ways to buy crypto, but the lesson remains. Crypto is a service, where financial transactions can take place. Cuba does not accept US dollars, and wire transfers can only be done Mon-Fri during the day, but...a person in Cuba can make a transaction with crypto at any hour of the day or night.

China banned crypto several times, with the full power of the fascist dictatorial central government. And yet...crypto is still available to anyone in China.

$USD used to be backed by gold in Ft Knox, and Nixon took us off the gold standard so the central government can print money, because the population was growing faster than the supply of mined gold.

11937,11937,1606,horupgb,t3_rhmjuw,"This will probably be an unpopular comment and down voted but I'm skeptical of the bull case for a sustained rise in the value of community coins with a reddit IPO. Sure, the value will likely increase some with a growing user base but I don't see the value proposition that would drive non-community members to invest in moons long term or what would drive an organic increase in demand.

I could be missing some of the functionality of moons, so please correct me if I'm missing anything, but is there anything that you can purchase with moons that you can't directly purchase with fiat? 

Admittedly, I couldn't care less about customizing my avatar or signature so I'm not the target consumer, but to me moons only serve a function if their cost to me is 0, or at least less than the equivalent cost of the services/goods I can exchange them for. I'm happy to receive moons only so long as I don't have to pay for them. That sets a hard practical upper limit on the value of a moon or any other community token, regardless of the token's scarcity. 

Scarcity of the asset doesn't drive increased asset value because once the asset value exceeds the limit defined by the fiat equivalent of the Reddit commodities that the CC can be exchanged for, it no longer makes sense to purchase moons. The only reason I can think of to purchase moons at a value greater than that is bragging rights (look, I have more moons than you) but that will only matter to a very small group of users.

Outside of exchanging CC's for Reddit commodities and bragging rights, what other utility should I, or others, believe in that would suggest this project is anything more than a way to get premium content from Reddit for free? Don't get me wrong, I think that's a good feature of Reddit, but I don't see how that translates into sustained price growth.

Outside of the practical value limit as a unit of exchange for Reddit commodities, a price increase could be driven by degenerate speculation (afterall, how many people really DYOR before fomoing into a coin?). However, my assumption is that would only drive a short term price spike to an ATH; followed by a dump once the hype wears off.

I'm not bashing moons (as you can see I hold a few), just trying to provide the counter case to OP's hopium. 


Tl;Dr: If you want to profit from your moons, sell on the price pump (if any) following Reddit IPO. Long term bull case not clear.",t3_rhmjuw

For example, threads that are dominated by monotonous pun after pun after pun.  Jokes are great, but man it's nice to have well thought out questions and answers too.

Additionally, in r/askreddit there is a relentless wave of repetitive questions worded slightly differently.  How many questions do you want to entertain about super powers, what would you do with one day left to live, and what have you done that is cringeworthy?

For the longest time I've wanted Reddit to split into two categories:  RedditSerious and RedditBullshit.  It would be so nice to let everybody participate the way they want, but be able to quickly hide the bull.

I'm not thinking just of NSFW threads on Reddit, either. Reddit has a lot of lefty subreddits that are very active. r/antiwork and r/wallstreetbets have both attracted attention in mainstream media, and not the sort of attention that makes corporate types happy.

If Reddit attempts to purge its political, NSFW and generally controversial subreddits in the aim of ""not offending people"" well, I expect a mass exodus of the users that make this place fun. It will turn into something like Facebook, or more likely, a dying husk like Tumblr.",t3_rhix16

17772,17772,3630,hotwm1d,t3_rhybix,This will be a good company one day but all their drugs are in phase 1. It will be years until they make solid revenue.

18107,18107,193,hpfpmco,t3_rlhfes,So it means you have the option to buy at $12.77 per share no matter what the price is.  If it was worth $15 at the IPO you would make $2.33 per share.  If it was worth $100 at the IPO you would make $87.23 per share etc.  On the other hand if it is only worth $10 at the IPO you could choose not to exercise the options at all otherwise you would lose money per share.  So basically you have no risk.,t3_rlhfes

18111,18111,197,hpfsywv,t1_hpfpmco,"This is correct. A few additional things to consider:
- Your strike price of $12.77 was likely determined by a 409A valuation by a third party. The primary value in the options is the potential in growth over the options period until going public. 
- If you leave your company, you will need to choose whether to exercise your vested options when you leave — because the company isn’t public yet there will be greater uncertainty around their ultimate value and you might have to wait a while before being able to cash out.

In June 2019 I read that book and stopped again. I never looked back and there wasn’t a single situation where I doubted my decision or had cravings to drink again.

20185,20185,21,hp89am9,t3_rk5aq4,"I gave up drinking several years ago to improve my health. I was not an alcoholic but I could see the negative effects alcohol had on me. 

Until you don’t drink, you don’t realize how pervasive alcohol is in our society. Simple things make not drinking really hard. Go to a restaurant and (if they serve alcohol) the beverage menu is often longer than the food menu. First thing the waiter says is, “what would you like to drink” and when I say “water,” I often get the death stare. It is on TV everywhere. New Years Eve is the absolute pinnacle of drinking. Try and go to a NYE party and not drink. It’s really, really hard and not a lot of fun, many times. 

I don’t criticize anyone for drinking. I don’t ever make a big deal of it when I’m out. But I point this out to show it is REALLY hard to quit drinking and continue to exist as a functioning adult in society. Drinking is not socially acceptable, it is socially expected.

20224,20224,60,hp8c87b,t3_rk5aq4,Yes! And I think there also needs to be more considerations for holiday gifting of something that isn’t alcohol. I’ve met people who buy wines for like 40-60 people (I work in the corporate gifting world this time of year) and feel that someone on that list has to have a history with alcoholism. I no longer buy alcohol as a gift for anyone as I never want to “spread joy” by potentially fucking with their addictions that I — their coworker and/or friend — might not even know about.

Fast forward to now and my life is great—amazing, supportive boyfriend, beautiful boys, a good job, etc etc but I was still drinking to numb out. I finally got mental health help and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder—why I felt I needed to escape through drugs and alcohol. DBT has been amazing, but I do flinch at the commercials and the dreams where I have a sip of wine and then feel the shame. 

I appreciate your post so much, and I am so proud of you. Getting sober is the one of hardest things I’ve ever done…but not nearly as hard as living a half-lived life hurting myself and the people I love.

20421,20421,257,hp7wjwc,t1_hp7tdzt,"Amen! I was diagnosed with AUD as a teen. I joined AA when I was 19. Alcoholics Anonymous refers to my type of drunk as a “low-bottom” drunk because they have to lose a lot. Well I thought at 19 I was at rock bottom but for the next many decades I failed at sobriety over and over. I had sponsors and I did step work and volunteer work and I still couldn’t stop. I was in and out of psych hospitals and rehabs for many years. Like she says seizures suck and medical detox saved my life over and over.

I tried hypnotherapy, electro convulsive therapy, equine therapy, naltrexone tablets (which I just wouldn’t take), religion, tried pulling myself up by my bootstraps thinking that success in business would fix it but it just made it worse… nothing seemed to help until a few years ago when they first offered Vivitrol (injectable naltrexone). It was once a month so it had time to work and didn’t matter if I was compliant or not.

I was on the injections for over a year before I got to the point of cessation and almost 3 years total. I’m now a medical cannabis patient and I do psilocybin therapy with my nurse practitioner wife as maintenance treatments and I’m now 608 days alcohol free.

While I don’t personally agree 100% with this Ted presenter’s views on the disease model of AUD (I feel that it eliminates some personal accountability and is often used by us alcoholics to deflect responsibility) it’s the best we’ve got and thanks to modern medical science I am sober today.

I was just watching a documentary with Dax Shepard about how a friend of his found an AA book with all these dates crossed out, but the last one wasn't crossed out. Dax said he was super embarrassed that his friend found out about his addiction, but the friend had seen it in a different light. He saw it as amazing that Dax hadn't given up. He had tried and failed and kept going at it, but he hadn't ever stopped fighting.

I can say you shouldn't feel guilty or embarrassed and try to go easy on yourself, but I know it's a lot harder than it is to say those things. Like other's have mentioned, one minute at a time, one hour, one day. Try your best not to look too far ahead into the future. As much as you can, ground yourself in the moment. It's okay to feel like you're weak. It's okay to feel like you can't do it. These things are normal. These feelings come along with the human experience.

You just keep doing what you’re doing and you’ll be fine. A popular saying in my Group is: “What other people think about me is none of my business.” I’m sharing this with you because it worked for me. I don’t know how much time you have, but the longer you’re sober, the easier it is to lead a life that you can be humbly proud of, instead of being mired in that constant cycle of guilt, shame, and remorse. The change is so gradual that you won’t even notice it, but one day you’ll be reviewing your day in your nightly meditations and realize how much your thinking and behavior have changed since you put down that last drink. You will be confident enough that you are a good person, and truly feel that just as *we* don’t have to like everyone, everyone doesn’t have to like *us,* and those who don’t… well, that’s *their* loss. It is truly freeing, especially in a world full of assholes. And Redditors.

In the meantime, the holidays *are* particularly hard for us, and you did the right thing by “telling on yourself.” When we don’t admit that we’re struggling, it gives that beast the opportunity to start whispering bad things to us.

I drank too much regularly for about 5 years, not like blacking out missing work, DUI, police involved stuff - just in my house after work and got into no trouble but drinking too much.

I could also go without it and not get negative physical effects (some cravings though). Sorry I'm rambling but anyway my point is I read the book and then went 65 days sober, drank one day, then went another 2 weeks, drank and I'm 3 days in and have decided I don't enjoy or need alcohol anymore.

21750,21750,708,hpd1hmw,t1_hpcjlip,"Doesn't change the fact that eToro is just an online broker and it has never been able to proof it actually holds any GME shares. 

a) They are not a DTCC registered broker

b) They are registered outside the US (Cyprus iirc, because taxes) so they can legally sell you CFDs

c) They freaked out about the shareholder voting back in June and ended up making some dodgy template to allow GME holders to vote, after weeks of a lot pressure to allow shareholders to vote

d) They don't allow DRS and they can't tell us exactly why. They don't allow regular broker-to-broker transfers either.

e) They constantly change and/or disable users ability to sell short (with a CFD which is fair enough), as well as changing the levels of leverage users can use on securities depending on the price action and outlook for that particular security. 

An example: I opened a short position on Evergrande back in July on eToro. Couple days later after doing more DD on Evergrande and China I felt confident enough to add more to my position with 2X leverage. But by then they had already disabled leverage use on Evergrande shorts but not while going long. About a week before the news broke about Evergrande in late August, they disabled shorts on it all together. It can't be because they can't locate shares to short because you only use CFDs when selling short on eToro. They do the same shit all the time with shitcoins that moon or with pump n dump stocks. They do the same with GME, conveniently allowing leverage just as GME is about to dip by $100 over two weeks. 
They do it because they're on the other side of those trades because all those trades are CFDs.

f) They actually posted [this](https://ibb.co/FnnGW0q)

They're very likely using some sort of swap contracts as an insurance for all the GME CFDs/IOUs that they've sold us.",t3_rkuxnd

21780,21780,738,hpcn3al,t1_hpce2ex,"Susquehanna own a tiny percentage of the company. Stop with this misinformation and FUD.  

After digging more into who owns the private company that is Etoro until they IPO we can safely say that this is at least very misleading or at worst this is dangerous FUD designed to get people to sell their shares knowing there is no transferring on Etoro.  
  
eToro was founded as RetailFX in 2007\[10\] in Tel Aviv, by brothers Yoni Assia and Ronen Assia together with David Ring.\[11\]  
  
Between 2007 and 2013, the company raised $31.5 million in four rounds of funding.\[14\]\[15\] In December 2014, it raised $27 million from Russian and Chinese investors.\[16\] In December 2017, it joined CoinDash as partners to develop Blockchain-based social trading.\[17\] In 2018, it raised a further $100 million in a private funding round.\[18\] Overall, more than $162 million has been invested in the company by investment firms Spark Capital, SBI Holdings, Germany's CommerzVentures, Chinese bank Ping An Insurance,\[19\] SBT Venture Capital, Russian state-owned financial firm Sberbank,\[20\] Korea Investment Partners, technology-focused BRM Group, and China Minsheng Financial Holdings.\[4\]\[21\]\[22\] Other investors and equity shareholders include Eli and Nir Barkat, Alona Barkat, Chemi Peres and Pitango VC fund, Digital Currency Group, Softbank, Betsy Z. Cohen, Eddy Shalev and Genesis Partners, Avner Stepak (Meitav Dash Investment House), Bracket Capital.\[9\]\[19\]  
  
So along with the equity all these investors own and the probably large percentages the 3 founders own we can pretty safely say that Susquehanna would be very unlikely to own equity large enough in Etoro to be able to sway internal Etoro decisions in any meaningful way. Especially in a way that would undoubtedly hugely harm Etoros reputation and in turn destroy value of the other investors equity in Etoro. Especially before an IPO.

&nbsp;
Edit: Here's a run down of the FUD vectors and some facts that counter them...

&nbsp;
>**NFTs are horrible for the environment**

&nbsp;
The most NFT-dense chain (Ethereum 1.0) uses less energy than the US video games industry. ETH 2.0 will use 90%+ less energy than that next year. A decent and growing percent of that energy is from renewables. Plus the Crypto Climate Accord is already working to realize the goal of a 100% renewables based crypto industry.  

&nbsp;
>**NFTs are just a bunch of jpegs of bad art / NFTs are useless**

&nbsp;
[10 Practical NFT Use Cases Beyond Digital Artworks](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/nft-use-cases/)  

&nbsp;
>**NFTs promote art theft**

&nbsp;
IP theft predates NFTs. Also the immutable blockchain ledger and crypto wallets which require ""Know Your Customer"" identification provide the best trail of evidence you're likely to get in regards to theft/piracy of digital goods. The art thief that minted your work as an NFT left a ledger history leading right to their wallet, the thief who stole all your work and is pretending to be you on social is a goddamn ghost. NFT marketplaces will also likely work with you to resolve any IP theft or fraud.  

&nbsp;
>**NFTs in games are soulless money grubbing by developers**

&nbsp;
NFTs in games will allow you to MAKE MONEY playing them though things like item shops, providing in-game services etc. The point of some finance-focused NFT games is to allow you to ""play to earn"". A lot of early Axie Infinity players got rich from the game, how much did you make watching Blizzard nerf your favorite Overwatch hero fifty times in a row?  

&nbsp;
>**NFTs are a scam**

&nbsp;
Scams exist in crypto/defi, undeniably so. Still spotting the hallmarks of scams is the first thing you learn on the road to becoming savvy in this space. The folks who wind up getting scammed in NFT land are like the type of people who fall for email phishing scams. These are low info users who didn't the DD before spending 10 ETH on an NFT of a vampire donkey somebody told them about on Discord. Did they check the blockchain history to see it had no transactions or maybe it was wash traded to pump the price? Of course not. Having a single brain wrinkle can fix this.  

&nbsp;
>**Artists lose money minting NFTs because gas fees are high**

&nbsp;
NFTs can be minted on chains far far cheaper than Ethereum. Also ETH 2 fees will be far cheaper with sharding planned post-merge next year (or use an L2 like Loopring right now to cut gas fees 90+%). Also NFTs can provide royalties to artists when their work is resold creating an income stream from their past , long sold-off works. Right now they only get paid on the first sale. Imagine a prolific artist still getting royalties from NFTs they sold 20 years ago.

And why you see massive FUD articles about the tech while simultaneously articles stating “no one really knows what the metaverse means yet, but only facebook can pull it off.” That’s why “you won’t hear us talking a big game or broadcasting our plans to the competition” is so brilliant. It leaves the media  grasping at straws and unable to build up solid smear campaigns. That’s why it pisses them off so bad at earnings when GME doesn’t give any guidance.

Wait for the FOMO.

A few other points which need to be considered as to why a $1B valuation of the ""core"" business no longer makes any sense:

\- Current cash on hand > $1.4B

\- 30% growth last Q

\- 350 new hires from Amazon, Chewy, Microsoft and others

\- Increasing customer engagement and satisfaction - Increased inventory and warehouses for deliveries, USA call centers, much improved social media presence...

These few points alone SHOULD alter the growth calculations of any forward model.  I have no idea where GameStop will be a year or five years from now but there is certainly some ground-breaking shit happening.

That being said course a company should at least have a higher valuation than a year before other wise it would be really a dying company.

Those points you mentioned definitely contribute to an growth in value but business wise the sale numbers are still behind 2019 and the year over year growth is compared to one of the worst years in retail. The hires did not all come directly from big tech and previously had mostly smaller rolled than now which means their move might as well be career and money driven.

23218,23218,2176,hmxjfr2,t3_r748g1,"I listened to the interview.

Ken does a good job trying to remain relatively neutral/indifferent to the Gamestop outcome (whether the company transforms or not) but he does stake an opinion that he doesn't think they can rationalize their 'oversized' store fleet and create new types of consumer value. 

What I do think he stumbled on a bit was if Melvin ever did close out their short position but he seemed to think Melvin was mostly out by January 25th and this is when the $2B cash infusion came. Melvin may very well have used that $2B to re-short that day, and the next, only to wake up with the price at $480 that Thursday. 

You can't cover a short position, especially one of that magnitude, while the price is falling. It might be they did start covering in weeks later when the price hit $40 and promptly went to $200 and never looked back. But the original short position is still there. 

You also have probably a lot of new shorts which have been entered the entire year from $400 - $150... A lot of those are in the green and are looking good. Gamestop really needs to break an ATH and hold it for a week or more before people's risk get's them antsy. 

Unfortunately we've been waiting almost a year and we're just treading water, but I have full faith in RC and team. I just really don't like giving these other guys time to figure out more ways to stall, delay and mitigate risk for a bet that is so terribly wrong. If you're wrong you should pay and they broke all the rules in January.   


We do have an undeniably rising floor and a lot of support over $170 but I do worry that we need to get SOME news in to get some new buyers interested. We're all hoping its the NFT Marketplace announcement. I really don't know if they're ready or they are going to launch in Q4...

Q: “Is there any way of covering without buying the shares to deliver?”

A: “In 99.99% of times, no.”

Then goes on some bullshit tangent about fiat cash covering. What about can kicking FTDs and deep OTM puts? When they took on Melvin’s shorts to delay the implosion on this trade, I guarantee he was thinking, “No problem. We’re in the same boat, but we’re smarter and can leverage the MM capabilities of the other side of the house to not only unwind this, but to make lots of money in the process.” 

Then a bunch of “dumb money” started to unravel the whole scheme piece by piece until they learned that there’s really no downside to being long on GME. 

SHFs do nothing and watch the real price emerge? Marge N has your ass on speed dial. Dip it sub 150 and watch the float get bought up by retail apes. Dip even further, you now have to deal with institutional big money against you in droves on this trade too. Nothing you can do but keep it channeled in that low volume sweet spot. 

All the while, apes are DRSing and causing a liquidity crisis. Not to mention, at ANY MOMENT, that E-commerce transformational leader that you’re now praising openly can turn the key, press the red button and vaporize you with an unexpected announcement.

Maybe the last year has toned that ego down, maybe not. But seeing Kenny on tour makes me think that we’re entering the pre-damage control chapters of this saga. They know that WE KNOW what we own.

You *can* buy to cover, but you can also add collateral to cover. As such, ""covering"" is ambiguous because it can be done in multiple ways. Which is *exactly* why hedgies are using it, because it sounds like they are saying they closed the positions (in the context of when it's discussed), but in reality all it means is that they added collateral.

look at the definition of ""cover"" on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cover.asp)

A few key snippets:

First:

> The term cover in the context of finance is used to refer to **any number of actions** that reduce an investor’s exposure.

Second:

> Covering is different than closing a position, in that with covering, an investor might choose to keep a position open, but just have enough stock on hand to compensate for any risk.

Third:

> **Covering vs. Closing**
> Closing out a position and covering a position can be the exact same thing in finance, but the two phrases have different connotations. In the ""buy to cover"" example that was discussed above, the investor could choose to close the position by delivering the shares or they could let it run knowing that they now hold the shares to cover it. The act of covering does not necessarily mean closing the position. To cover is to take a defensive action to lower the risk exposure of a position, investment, or portfolio of investments.
> Close or closing, by contrast, suggests that the risk is being fully eliminated by exiting the position creating exposure.",t3_r748g1

Covering is different than closing a position, in that with covering, an investor might choose to keep a position open, but just have enough stock on hand to compensate for any risk.

Cover can also be used without context to simply mean the act of protecting overall portfolio value, as in providing cover against market volatility.


Often, the way an investor limits liability is by placing an offsetting trade that counters the potential risk of one already placed.

- I guess this also means that Conde Nast Publications / Advanced Publications have lost money or otherwise they have been financially punished or threatened with relation to Reddit.

- So then the censorship that Fidelity does in the fidelityinvestments subreddit, those censorship humans will censor the fuck out of the entire site far more bullyingly and totalitarianly, oppressively,tyranically, stockholm syndromely than already

- Who is the CEO? spez

- November, 2016, a redditor posted evidence indicating that Reddit administrators had modified multiple user comments. Following this post Huffman took responsibility for the comment modifications, writing that “Our community team is pretty pissed at me, so I most assuredly won’t do this again.”

- spez, remember that Aaron Swartz was either murdered/killed and framed as a suicide, or even if he was not murdered and that Aaron Swartz,as brilliant as he was, that his brain concluded that he must commit suicide as a solution, that if Aaron Swartz's brain was that smart to no longer be alive (again, even if he was murdered and propagandishly framed as a suicide by financial terrorist hired hitmen, or fbi, domestic terrorists, etcetera), that the position any human is in to survive and stand up against the corruption, it requires a lot of willpower.",t3_rhp8xs

Those with large positions in a company can indeed influence how it's run, but at the same time, it's not a forgone conclusion, and that influence would take time if those who have controlling interest actually don't want to make something bad happen.  

Shorting reddit out of existence would take years, but in the near term, getting to the actual IPO date, hedge funds gaining enough influence to assign board members, that board doing what would need to be done to have something happen to the sub, that action probably taking months to happen since doing it suddenly would raise red flags, makes it seem like anything we have to worry about could be a year or two away....at the earlier.

If MOASS takes that long, I hate to say it, but reddit shutting down the sub probably isn't going to be the subs biggest concern.  The bigger concern would be people leaving because they're annoyed at either it not MOASS'ing, or the constant fear mongering which gets old week after week.

All that said, I can't see wall street trying to short reddit out of existence.  It's too valuable a vehicle for them to push their P&D's on the common man.

24818,24818,6,hp6r09a,t3_rjy5rc,"Incredible analysis!

About the only thing I would disagree with is the scale of the war (i.e. 50 million guerillas), but it'd still be catastrophic. I would put the number at a million at most, because I think it's a good midpoint between my low end and high-end numbers.

My basic disagreement comes from methodology; you're looking at firearm ownership in general, while I'd prefer to look at pre-existing militia groups. I believe militia membership is a far better predictor because it shows us which people are *already* open about the idea of using violence to achieve their political goals if it came to it. Obviously, far more people would join the fray and create new groups if fighting starts, but I believe looking at armed groups that already exist is the best baseline, because they've already spent years ""psyching themselves up"" for something like this.

Either way, my reasoning is that at any given moment there are around 150-200 militia groups in the US. Some groups are larger and some are smaller, but let's assume an average of around battalion-strength (i.e. 300 people). That would give us a core of around 60,000 people, and our low end.

For our high end, that would be 10-11 million people, or about 3% of the total US population. I say this because I study conflicts and it seems that only a single-digit percentage of people generally join the fighting. Even at the height of WW2, in a state of total war, with vast government powers to conscript and train as many people as needed, only about 9% of the US was mobilized.

The same pattern holds true for irregular conflicts. Afghanistan has almost 39 million people and Iraq 40 million, but the US military didn't face millions of insurgents swarming their tens of thousands of troops. Certainly, there were millions of passive supporters of the insurgency(i.e. people who agree with an insurgency even if they don't do anything to help it along), but the amount of people willing to actually pick up a gun and take shots is relatively low even among a hostile populace.",t3_rjy5rc

I'm talking Javelin, and Stinger Missiles, AP/AT Mines, claymores mines, C4, AT4 shoulder fired rockets, and don't even get me started on the sheer amount of Squad Automatic Weapons. I've said it once, and I'll say it again; the US Military is severely ill equipped to fight an Insurgency an Ocean away, let alone in their own backyard. Dissertions would be common to avoid targeting of family members, and moreso to defect. Everybody likes to pretend our Military is the shit, but the fact is it's a house of cards with infinite possibilities to collapse it. There's a reason they never came for the guns.

For a civil war, you need two sides escalating an arms race of organization for years, and lines of some sort drawn, even if they aren't conventional. Militia-forming and the rhetoric of war is entirely one-sided in this country. The only other way would be the military splitting and fighting itself.

The reality is that it would not get that far.

* Only 1% or less of the population will fight. This tracks with civil conflicts like the Ulster troubles. Of course in USA that's 3+ million people.

* Our military leadership sucks. They have an overblown sense of their own strength, they can't beat guerilla forces anywhere, and they are enormously corrupt. We should expect that they will act reactively and stupidly to provocations.

* There are no militarized ideologically 'left' centers of violence. The right wing will completely own the guerilla theater, and have a much larger base of support than any 'left' or traditionally liberal faction. The liberals will be the largest faction and will be totally reliant on a failing state to help them.

* Our elites and politicians are mostly weak fools and I expect many of them to be captured or killed by insurgents easily if this thing pops off. There is a middling-millionaire gentry that will fund and support the rightist insurgency in these scenarios. The big bourgeoisie will not be able to hold things together, and they have thrown in completely with the corrupt and mushy liberal center that cannot last.

* 'Foreign propaganda' is often overblown. The USA is killing itself just fine without too much interference. Putin and Xi just met and essentially signalled a new Eurasian military alliance and economic sphere. It is no accident that the Russians immediately released a list of *demands* to NATO for the first time since the dissolution of the USSR. The Russians and PRC can now deal with the west from a position of assurance and strength. They will act according to those demands, which are: back away from our borders, leave us alone, or else. Of course their intel agencies are acting to disrupt things here, but a full blown *collapse* of USA power isn't in their interest. They want a managed retreat of the Imperial forces so that no batshit homicidal Yankee decides to end all life on Earth while this all goes down. In that, I'm decidedly on their side.

Do you have any idea how many guns the military has or how irrelevant 1900 guns is to a conflict in the US?

>There are over 400 million guns in this country and a population of about 330 million.

A military isn't just a bunch of guys with guns. Where do they muster? What is their command structure? Where are their bullet factories? How will they communicate? Store bought walkie-talkies aren't encrypted or appropriate for war. How many are fit to serve and trained? Most people have never been in the military and 40% of the country is obese. How do they feed hundreds of thousands who aren't working? Gas? Medicine?

A ton of these guys are bluffing. They *swore* it would be Civil War 2 if Biden won and only 8000 were serious about it, mostly unarmed. When they actually consider leaving their job and mortgage to lose their house and try telling their wife they have to leave to maybe die or go to prison to shoot at US soldiers, it all falls apart.

If you wanna see what a popular armed insurrection against a military looks like, see how that turned out for Chechnya. Or Kurdistan. Or ISIS. Who ended up in charge after the war?

Thanks for a well laid out interesting Post

Do have questions though...I lived overseas in Thailand and a while in Philippines both countries have long term instability issues, Thailand alone has had 22 military coup in 80 years and dozens of failed constitutions..also both countries in some ways has used marital law at periodic times to sometimes no success. 

Wondering based on your insight which seems to be pretty wide viewed world wise if you could see the USA just having long term instability issues or just years of bouts of instability not necessarily a full blown civil war namely

 failed elections
Occasionally assassinations
- Insurgency groups created due to idiotic failed attempts at handling situations that got people unnecessary killed which pissed off locals, friends, family etc creating a insurgency
- off and on using martial law
- essentially having the US military in charge of everything including military basically being president and everything else
- militant groups would be likely to setup check points, 

Also as for the 50 million insurgency I could see it happening and maybe this is just me

Honestly people don't take kindly to there friends, family, loved ones getting killed off, don't underestimate the power of wanting revenge, also insurgency group would also be likely as it's basically not realistic that the state, city officials can maintain security. 

As for corporations and power if being realistic, look from financial news most have spent the last few years and even now only doing mostly stock buybacks there not really investing in anything substantial. to be honest I wouldn't be either 

also don't forget corporations are about money and power, let's assume trump takes control, if he can successful take over enough areas he could get corporations to do basically anything other wise he could just use any number of options to get them closed, taken over, massive Trump supporter backlash, it's not really hard to envision any number of things to be used against a corporation that isn't being Trump friendly

Also while this sounds messed up how quickly do you think corporate executives will sign up to support anything if there family suddenly gets kidnapped, or a outspoken executive gets assassinated, or people just suddenly disappearing.",t3_rjy5rc

That said:




Trump, Republican congressman and other high levels officials all conspired to overthrow the government. You're pretending like none of this exists. This is insane.

Trump purposely undermined democracy and our elections with a premeditated plan - for example He continuously sewed the idea into people's heads that the elections weren't secure, while simultaneously the republican-controlled Senate refused to even look at a dozen separate bills the House passed to shore up election security between 2016 and 2020.

He then lost the election and claimed, along with his lawyers and others, to have a mountain of evidence of widespread election fraud, he then lost 67 court cases in a row, often in front of judges he had hand picked himself, never showing a single scrap of evidence of this ridiculous claim of widespread election fraud.

It got so bad that highly respected cyber security expert Christopher Krebs, who ran CISA at the time, began running a website to debunk Trump's fascist election fraud lies, and then Trump found out about it and fired him(along so, so many other important people that the public is unaware of).

Then after January 6th Republicans literally stripped Liz Cheney of her committee seats and power in Congress because she refused to go along with the lie that Trump won the election. Months and months after the election. 

This is a crystsl clear signal that Republicans are interested in rules by force, not democracy - the entire party including the heads are illegitimizing our elections and undermining our democracy by pretending the election was not secure, and that it was stolen. This is so unbelievable just on its own that I'm shocked every day but people aren't up in arms about this.

Now I don't mean to say that can't happen but there is a reason for that.  Revolution on a large scale typically comes from those that feel that don't have much to loose.  We live in a nation where we go to the grocery store for food, freakout when gas prices go up, manufacturing is in large part over seas (although we do have a decent amount here).  While people care about their family's and will want to protect them that doesn't just include violent action but also food security, maintaining in anyway they can their standard of living.  

Two you seem to have framed this as if it would be most of the civilian population vs the military.  Keep in mind that mostly like there would be different ""safe areas"" for different factions.  Different military factions will have safe areas that have sympathetic civilian populations that they can launch operations from and try and form logistic lines in.  No gorilla warfare is very effective but not universally effective but keep a few things in mind.  Civilians will not have a effective way to take on the navy and its own air force.  Nuclear powered carriers that can supply at safe harbors, foreign ports, have defense system and escorts that would make civilian approach impossible.  Now we can maybe the navy would fracture but then whatever faction of the navy comes out on top is in the same position as the whole navy was before.  

Three I think it would be interesting if we looked at the geography of the US although for this I don't have a specific point to make but rather somethings I think should be kept in mind.  The west is extremely vulnerable due to water shortages.  A few bombs on some dams and millions are without water with no real way to supply them with water outside of massive transportation networks to transport bottled water that likely still wouldn't work.  
Large amounts of produce are located in California.  
The plain states.  Large swaths of agriculture on flat open ground.  This is a very important area because of the rivers that run through those areas and the crops produced there.

This will be enhanced by real and false flag gurrilla attacks wit the intent to get the angry states to surrender ask for help and tow the line. Next the game gets exposed and several states unite and declare sucession and the US fractures into several regions while the federal government asks for foreign military assistance.

If we could find a way to facilitate peace talks between the leaders of disparate militias and thus bolster their power, we may actually be able to shift the balance of power in this country between political constituents and politicians. 

Sounds far fetched in terms of creating a meaningful shift except if you consider the near term government split that many predict will occur around the next election.

If an internal armed conflict were to spill over into the government's reaction would most probably be extremely swift. Not just the military, the Mounties, and all levels of police. During the October Crisis a large chunk of French Canadians approved of what was basically a military occupation of the province. I remember the Quebec October Crisis, I was there. 

If refugees start coming over the border, the situation in the US would have to be insanely bad. The US is a huge country,  most people would rather move from conflict zones to safer areas. Becoming a political refugees means that , unless you can transfer some of your assets out of the country, you loose everything. 

Some may want to move before they have to. That means that they would be going through the immigration process. It's a lot harder than most Americans think. 

The big crisis of refugees would come at when one side or the other senses they are going to loose or have lost and fear the new government.

- isis has been nearly defeated (in syria, anyways) because just about everybody and their grandmother were fighting against them. nato, russia, iran, iraq, syria, the rebels, and even other islamic extremists were all fighting against them - there wasn't anyone actively arming them besides western weapons manufacturers, and even then most of their arms had been taken from former us military bases in iraq. keep in mind that they still managed to control huge swaths of territories and spread out into both africa and afghanistan, as well as cause a shitload of damage. also - *syria isn't a guerilla war.*
- kurdistan is still actively fighting after several years

To that end guerrilla warfare and sustained low level terrorism seems very likely. With some sort of military protection of key infrastructure maybe.

I remember doing sewage, water, electricity, academics, trash, medical, safety and other assessments while in these Nations as a field grade army officer.  We called this a SWEAT-MSO. This was focused at the town or provincial level.

It will start, and possibly end the way Nazi Germany did.  First there were revolutionary communists who took a government building and started a revolt, then there were the far right reactionaries who reacted to places like the Soviet Republic of Munich by killing a thousand civilians and protesters, those were the antecedents to the SA, the Freikorps (essentially ""freedom militia"" in German).  Then you will have a continuation of this far right reactionism before you have the camps built up and then the possible execution of those prisoners.  That's the doomsday scenario and not at all impossible, the world already watched it happen once and did nothing about it until they had their military forces guilty up and they became more extremely violent.  I would say the German's went through it first, that type of reaction between right and left, but there have always been reactionaries to descending states, like Rome.  You have to kill someone who wants to abolish debt or who wants to give up on the military industrial complex.  The aristocrats were still in control of Nazi Germany even if they did tentatively fear Hitler, he loved them.  He thought of them as his friends, and they thought of him as unstable, look at what Elon Musk said about the abortion ban in Texas to get an idea of the way a rich industrialist will behave.  He probably thinks they are unstable to, they caught him on camera shaking Trumps hand, he doesn't care, and the rich industrialists never cared when an unstable person came to power unless he was a communist.  As long as that person is on their side, they will be allowed to live with that instability, because they are not connected to everyone's reality and they barely have been.  German factory worker's days got worse after the rise of power in Hitler, but they still voted him in.  I guessing the industrialists were and to make a certain amount of profit in that time, because they were all using slave labour, that's what those people in the camps were for.  It was a ""Golden Age"" in German history according to a lot of the interviews that were taken of German's after the war.  Even after the war, Hitler was still regarded as the hero, and the German's were only mad that they lost.  It doesn't mean that everyone believed in the cause, but if there are enough people that do believe, you will either be forced to go along with it or end up in jail.  The only difference is that there is no one to bail us out from this one.  There will just be multiple state actors watching from afar, only, unlike Germany, we're not bankrupt and powerless to control our economy, at least our politicians aren't, there was no major war debt on us, the rest of the world looked at our economy and rightfully thought that we were/are the richest, because we still are.  Germany had a lot of technological innovation, but was completely bankrupt.  We'll collapse like the Soviet State, only instead of becoming authoritarian communist, we will just become more fascist as we go along, and I truly think that's the darker path.

Fascism comes many flavours. 
A stable but isolationist U.S.A would make Russia and China very happy. 

This analysis like many others discount the actions of the rest of the world. The world will not care about U.S citizens but they will care about stability.",t3_rjy5rc
25394,25394,582,hp7yqk6,t1_hp7ue6e,"My father was born in Germany during the reconstruction and he said everything was ruined from what his parents, my grandparents, told him.  My grandfather was a German-Jewish refugee from before WW2, and my grandmother was just a German woman who was his playmate as a child before he emigrated.  My grandfather's family had a lot of wealth, possibly worth in the millions today and actually testified against Winterthur, a Swiss insurance company who took his mother's life insurance policy.  I read up on the war and always watched documentaries because my grandfather was in the eighth air force, so was fearful for his life in the sky and woke up with nightmares up until he was dead.  The nightmares did not stop, and they were always the same, being in a plane and thinking that he was going to die.  He would wake up surprised and go back to sleep.  I got the sense that he could not shake it, no matter how bad therapy or an intervention tried.  That's one of the things about PTSD; it never truly goes away.  His brothers came out through Europe and the middle east and made it to north and south America.

Doing a bit of studying on the times, you can see what revolutionary forces were developing in Europe, Hitler didn't appear out of nowhere, just like Donald Trump really didn't appear out of nowhere either.  The German politicians were surprised when they couldn't put Hitler in a corner and make him squeel.",t3_rjy5rc
