21,glf308r,t3_l8xnlk,"Let’s say AMC is a scam, we’ve all been deceived and AMC was made to be a scapegoat so the suits could save themselves from the GME assfucking they received. 

The stock is undervalued at the moment. Let’s say it drops to $5 and some of us bought at $15, don’t sell. The company has hit periods of over $10 and nearly $20 before, just be patient. If you own less than $100 or $1000 in AMC then hopefully it’s money you could’ve afforded to lose. So maybe you don’t see the short squeeze boom but you can make a nearly 50% return on the investment. 

For those of us who really went in $5000< then the same thing applies, to wait. Our short interest is nearly 50%, some places I see 79%, but we can do it. Yes GME had the insane short interest of 100%< but it’s the people who made it shoot it, if DFV and his army didn’t do what they did the stock wouldn’t have moved all that much. The same can be said for AMC, we have the power just not absolute power. 

Everyone is saying AMC can’t reach what GME reached, but GME isn’t dont growing. Saying AMC won’t reach GME currently is a cap of $500, but when their squeeze comes they might touch the $1000 mark. If AMC squeeze can hit GME pre-squeeze we’ve got a lot of cash to be made. 

So yes, maybe AMC is a distraction that fooled so many of us but let’s turn it on the fuckers. They think they trapped us, and maybe they did, but we’re literally too stupid to realize. Power lies where we choose to believe it lies, for AMC I choose to claim that power. I’m claiming it by holding out. I will hold this bag for myself, for you all, and for every single person the hedge funds/institutions fucked over. This isn’t a get rich quick scheme, it’s a movement.

You have lived my nightmare, and I can't even begin to imagine how horrible that must have been for you and your son and your whole family. My heart goes out to you all.

We don't hate you. Or people like you. It's not about when you were born. It's about how you act, how you treat others, how you see the world. A great deal of working class boomers and older gen-Xers like me have felt the same or similar struggles as the younger generations are now facing, though perhaps not as harshly. And people like you are hard working, dedicated, honest, decent people. True blue collar or even white collar workers are not the sort of people we mean when we say ""Ok boomer."" It's a mindset, not an age group. And you're not one of them. You're one of us.

We want society to be better. We want the world to be better. We want everyone to be taken care of and have a fair chance. The greedy pigs at the top, who only take and never give, they're the enemy. They're the ones who need to be knocked down a peg and forced to play along, so everyone else can be better off, and we can all prosper. There's more than enough for everyone, if only the few weren't so greedy and so crooked.

214,glff1f6,t3_l8xnlk,"My father got really fucked in the 2008 crisis by getting loans to pay his employees for 2 years with no clients and no income, thinking he would eventually bounce back. The man paid from his pockets the salaries of 20 people until he couldn't, which killed him animically. He got bankrupt in the end, getting a huge amount of debt which he just finished paying last year. These have been 13 years of misery for my family, plus this whole story caused my mother heavy mental health problems and a huge depression in my father. On top of that, both of his parents died of COVID early in march and he has just discovered that his siblings fucked him with the inheritance. He had a f*cking rough year.

I have never bet before and have put a big amount of my cash on GME despite being unemployed as soon as I saw Robin Hood manipulating the stock with their disgusting moves. I never have been very intelligent and I like the stocks, so this is the way. 

This whole week my father and mother have both been smiling like there is still some hope for good people in this world. Like literally tears in their eyes seeing people unite for a good cause. 

I don't care about the money, but if I win some, this goes for refurbishing their old house and a nice and long due family vacation. And of course I will give a good percentage to local charities here in Madrid Spain.

Seeing boomers and millennials going for the big guns is heartwarming. You guys gave us hope back on humanity. I don't care about the outcome. I don't care about losing it all. I love seeing your stories of resilience and success, of charity and of course of loss. Literally brings tears of joy to my eyes.

This is about karmic retribution against greedy people.

So, for them I am holding to the moon, my favourite planet. The planet of the apes. Unga Unga.

Let's get these billionaires you beautiful autistic retards.

I love you all.

You wanted candid thoughts so here's my take: 

Looking at the latest available data, the likelihood of a short squeeze happening is a lot lower than previously thought. Here's the latest [Ortex data](https://www.reddit.com/user/dana_G9/comments/l8x57c/ortex_gme_short_interest_28_jan/) on short interest; Fri's data not yet available. As of Thu, only 64% of the float on loan now. 

Sure, it's still high relative to other stocks but nowhere near the levels needed to sustain the price surge we've seen. Whilst redditors may trying to diamond hand this, Steve Cohen and the like mostly have covered most of their short positions. 

Also, bear in mind that there are many others out there, institutions included, who recognised an opportunity here and went long on the stock as well due to momentum and other factors. But as soon as the short interest thesis falls apart, they definitely would exit without a thought.

All the fracing companies are running a Ponzi scheme. Look at anandarko to oxy etc. I am sorry you suffered sadly after being one of the Enron guys who lost his ass I am always now skeptical. To the original poster you are a good man. Very generous l commend you.

Edited to add why it is a Ponzi scheme 

When you drill a gas well you contract for gathering and processing to get the ngls out. (Propane etc) you also contract for the gas to move on pipelines. You have to contract for your maximum amount. The problem with that is you have decline rates in the 30-70% a year. So let’s say you contract for 100 mmbtus molecules whatever

Day 1 you produce that but by day 365 you are down to 50. By day 730 you are down to 25. Etc etc. so you have to keep drilling to meet your contract commitments. Reality is the reserves are maybe there but unless you go re pressure the well it won’t come out easy. Remember we are talking about drilling 5 miles into the ground. They then take their results and base their equity on the reserve which is not there.",1,wallstreetbets,1612050545.0,1612046232.0

They may attempt multiple small squeezes in conjunction with more short ladder attacks to get us to lose interest and throw our money into shill shit like silver over the coming week. Fucking silver? You kidding me? Here's the facts: Their interest rates are absolutely insane. They cannot hold this forever, and as soon as the people who get to recall those shorts think that the hedges are going to bankrupt, its getting recalled. But these people are arrogant. The lunatics DOUBLED DOWN ON THEIR SHORTS. The float is still well clear of 100%. As long as we hold, there is nothing they can do. IT JUST WILL MAKE THE FINAL RECKONING BIGGER IF THEY WAIT. So do not despair if it seems to fizzle Monday.

401,glf0cp8,t3_l8xm9q,"Not financial advice, just monkey counting bananas.

I feel that this is an important post to make because of how many people have sell orders at $10k.

TLDR: $1K SELL ORDERS ARE LOW AND ISNT A MEME ANYMORE. $10K IS THE MEME! NO SELL ORDERS LOWER THAN $10K!

$1k was memed for so long that there will probably be another short ladder attack when it reaches that price, *ARTIFICIALLY* driving the price down briefly as soon as it reaches $1k. Artificially, because the price will go back up in a matter of hours.

“Why? Haven’t we won?” Well, we have won, but only for as long as we don’t sell. A short ladder at $1k WILL drive the price down *temporarily,* even during a squeeze. Sure, the short ladder will have to have more frequency and/or volume to make an impact, but the price will still momentarily go down.

As such, this short ladder is meant to ignite a panic sell, as everybody will have had two- to threefold return on their investment at that point. _HOWEVER,_ they will do this because *it can go higher than $1k.*

As you know, they will be forced to buy our shares at essentially infinite price to cover, so they would rather cover at $1k than at $10k or $100k. They have and will continue to do anything to get your tendies, so 🤲💎 you beautiful apes 🦍!

404,glf01n8,t3_l8xm9q," **There is a simple way for shortsellers to get out of this and retail investors get their tendies!**

We  always talk about, how we are in a prisoner's dilemma wit holding the  shares. But this also works on those greedy shortsellers!

If  just one hedge fund with a large short position starts to cover every  position. The price will go to the moon! This forces every shortseller  to do the same (price now on the way to Mars, sorry elon we will be the  first). After this ""mother of all short squeezes"" we are ready to take  some tendies at around 4.206,90$. Now the hedge fund who covered first,  can short the stock at the top , to get back a part of the losses (so  they have a interest to cover early!). We become millionaires and \~80%  of the shortsellers get roasted. The only shortseller who gets off  lightly is the one who first starts to cover and initiate the short  squeeze.

While holding shares is  for free. Shortsellers actually pay around 33% borrow fee. It is much  easier for us to hold the stock! This gives even more pressure on some  big shortsellers to be the first covering every short position. AND,  lets not forget we care about each other, while the hedge funds would  always sell out their shortseller friends!

BUT we have the power to gobble up that liquidity IF we buy those sells at the discounted prices and keep it ABOVE where we set the price. The liquid can continually flow if institutions try to short it, and if they decide to buy it that's all the better for us because we are the market maker and we can TP their longs, again, to a price that we can decide. Just so long as people understand that we are the market maker and we decide on the price, people need a certain level to which we don't buy anymore, and if it goes beyond our price we just eat their liquidity.

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

This letter? After reading it, the sentiment I get is that Warren is really just questioning the stability of financial markets and whether regulators are functioning properly. She really only mentioned WSB in the introduction and in the question 1aii towards the end. I don't really see how the letter is her pointing fingers at WSB specifically and saying we are the reason there are instabilities in financial markets",1,wallstreetbets,1612057886.0,1612046079.0

544,glfbbs6,t3_l8xivm,"First Post! 

Me and the many members over on “The Silver Forum” (please visit and check us out) have been stacking physical silver for years. Yes storage can be an issue once you’ve used all your kilo bars as door-stops! The problem in going long on physical silver is that the dealers and mints run out of physical stock fast and dealers just stop selling to see where spot price levels out. Then the TBTF just smash it down.

SLV is a joke don’t touch that or the 2x or 3x ETFs.

PSLV (Canadian) is where I’m buying on Monday via my SIPP (Pension). This going up when paper spot price goes down could de-couple the fake ass paper price from the physical price. 1oz of paper silver is not 1oz of physical silver. SLV ETF etc have hundreds of claims on the same physical oz of silver. PSLV is fully allocated  LBMA bars (those giant ones).

Anyway, well done on GameStop. You’ve achieved what we want to achieve with silver. 

Need some help! Buy 1oz of physical silver each from your mom n pop LCS store or just log on to the US Mint (or your country Mint) and get yourselves some real money. Silver / Gold

A) Silver has suffered the largest naked shorting % of anything on earth! (on 1-28-2021 in ONE DAY, 1.5 Billion oz. were naked dumped on the Comex - The estimated global production of silver in 2019 amounted to 27,000 metric tons.(27 000 metric ton = 952 396 972.64 ounce) So about 1.5 times annual global production shorted in one day!

B) Unlike GME; Silvers fundamentals are Outstanding!!!!

C) The silver market is certainly larger than GME, but not so large that a coordinated effort wouldn't produce a huge short squeeze and be hugely profitable.

D) I've seen posts suggesting SLV (ETF that I personally doubt has all the physical silver to fully back shares sold and even if they do it would be impossible for small retail investor to convert to physical) Also have seen suggestions for ETF PSLV which has all the silver to fully back shares sold and the ability to deliver physical for shares. Much safer for outright purchase but has disadvantage of no options available. Also have seen suggestions for the silver miner AG (First Majestic) This is a great company and has a has quite a lot of shorts but not nearly as high of percentage as GME",21,wallstreetbets,1612046489.0,1612045872.0

668,glfig0k,t1_glffhpx,"Honestly I have no fucking idea. I'm retarded.

In my opinion though, the silver market ***cant*** be squoze like GME has been.

You're dealing with global central banks and COMEX. Not small billion dollar hedge funds.

By that I mean, silver isnt going to go up 1500% to $400/oz no matter how mu h physical and/or paper silver autists buy.

HOWEVER

silver is a VERY HEAVILY shorted commodity, it has been artificially depressed for DECADES. Not only that, but it is extremely in demand in industrial and real world use cases.

There was already a very strong bullish outlook for silver in 2021. Consensus was spot would hit $30 easy, possibly even up to $50/oz.

With added pressure from retards and autists worldwide I think that could easily push it to $100 maybe even $150/oz. That's a 500%-600% increase within the year. Maybe even 7 months.


NOW let's talk about premiums.

Unlike stocks, silver is a physical commodity. The real shortage is retail bullion of 100oz or less per bar,  round, etc. 

Silver regularly sells for 10%-30% over spot CURRENTLY because the demand already outpaces the supply by a lot.

So if spot went to $100/oz that's what you could buy contracts for (which are contracts for 1000oz comex bars)

BUT you couldnt get 1oz bars for that price. No way. The actual market value would likely be double that.

You submit, sending people look and then approve, receiving people then approve, then transfer happens.

Give all details correctly. Make sure all trades are settled before the transfer starts. (Two trading days after your last purchase/sale). Monday trade settles on Wednesday.

It's possible it'll rake a bit more because a lot of accounts are moving at once. But if you only have shares and don't plan on selling a move will be great.

For the RH bankruptcy risk and when they started selling GME from cash accounts that's a really bad sign.
