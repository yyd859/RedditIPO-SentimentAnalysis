9,gle7lvt,t3_l8si67,"PSA: Be aware of the most common strategy used by hedge funds right now: Divide and conquer. PROTECT $AMC

We are all aware of the bots here on reddit and other social networks advising people not to buy or sell $GME, by reading the threads you will start to find accounts telling you not to buy or sell $AMC and other stocks we like. 

Be aware that they have interest in those stocks too, these people are greedy and every penny counts to them. If they have a chance to kill $AMC first, they will.

For those who haven't figured it out yet, here's what I'm trying to explain: thanks to the hype many people are starting to invest, there are many people who want to join the battle but can't afford a single share of $GME, so they are interested in buying $AMC instead. But since they find redditors here advising not to buy $AMC they give up and don't support the battle at all. This is the strategy of hedge funds.

30,gled65i,t3_l8si67,"🚨🚨🚨Really Important 🚨🚨🚨

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there’s a lot more room to grow. On the high end we’re talking the possibility of hitting $150-200(even higher the longer we hold) a share if everyone is smart and holding until Thursday 

My recommendation: 
1. HOLD
2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it’s going to violently rise
3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it’s highest.(It will be high for some time)",79,wallstreetbets,1612035173.0,1612032407.0

Unfortunately, AMC mgmt couldn't forsee the future like [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/), so they issued a shitload of shares and convertible debt at lower prices, which makes the possibility of a moonshot like GME unlikely.

AMC said on Monday, January 25th, it had raised $917 million since mid-December through equity and debt issues, from the issuance of **186.7 new common shares**.

On Wednesday, January 27th, AMC said it raised an additional $304.8 million by selling **63.3 million additional shares** this week, cashing in on an unprecedented social media-driven rally powered by amateur traders taking on hedge funds that had shorted its shares.

On Thursday, January 28th, private equity firm and long-term AMC activist shareholder Silver Lake and other creditors decided to convert debt holdings to equity in a transaction expected to reduce AMC's obligations by $600 million, but result in further dilution to the outstanding shares.

On Friday, January 29th, it was reported that Silver Lake had sold the resulting **44.4 million shares** all on Wednesday, January 27th at an average price of **$16.05 each**.

So, totalling the above, that is 186.7 + 63.3 + 44.4 = **294.4 mln share dilution** to existing AMC shareholders. So, total shares outstanding have grown from 107 mln to a whopping **400 mln**! That is a massive dilution. That is why AMC is at $13 instead of $50 or higher already.

And it has been reported by Bloomberg that AMC is considering further offerings if the stock goes higher from the current $13 price.

All you retards might have diamond hands and HODLing onto your shares, but just like their over-priced popcorn, AMC is eager to issue as many new shares as possible at the current prices. Equity buyers are giving a much better deal than the company's bondholders that hold their $6 BLN in debt.

So, if AMC goes higher next week, it will be because of new buyers coming and bidding the shares up higher based on sympathy with GME, esp. if GME makes new highs above 500. But be aware unlike GME's mgmt, AMC mgmt, plus the funds that bought the 294 million new shares (minus 44 mln Silver Lake already dumped) at lower prices may dump into the buying frenzy. I don't remember ever seeing a short squeeze when the company is literally dumping 100s of millions of shares into the market with the promise to dump even more.",4,wallstreetbets,1612122535.0,1612032407.0

As for AMC : VW

They aren't much similar, like 40% of AMC is owned by a dozen or so institutional investors so there isn't the same type of dedication to the holding VW had, let alone the restricted share availability, making it pretty volatile. But its short position does offer room for some squeezing, the troublesome part is, how many of current investors are willing to take (potentially) another year of loss due to Covid 19. If the in guys start selling when the price goes up...its going to be tough to put up a wall to squeeze the shorts over the short term.

“I keep hearing that ‘most of the GME shorts have covered’ — totally untrue,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3′s managing director of predictive analytics, said in an email. “In actuality the data shows that total net shares shorted hasn’t moved all that much.”

“While the ‘value shorts’ that were in GME earlier have been squeezed, most of the borrowed shares that were returned on the back of the buy to covers were shorted by new momentum shorts in the name,” Dusaniwsky added.

The borrow fee on GameStop’s stock — or the cost-to-borrow shares for the purpose of selling them short — jumped to 29.32% on existing shorts and 50% on new short positions, S3 said.

“If most of the shorts had covered, we would not be seeing stock borrow rates at these high levels – by now you would be able to borrow GME stock at single digit levels due to an increase in the lendable stock loan supply due to borrowed shares being returned after all the ‘supposed’ buy-to-covers,” Dusaniwsky said.

GameStop remained the most shorted name in the market right now as short interest as a percentage of shares available for trading stands at 113.31%, S3 said.",2,wallstreetbets,1612053101.0,1612032314.0

I get the part where HFs over-shorted with non-existant shares. I get the part that some whales got behind us to get the price moving up (viking guy on twitter)

The part I do not get is that there is still volume, shares can still be bought ... why HFs don't buy them? Also, is everything resting on the shoulders of Roaring Kitty? Or he just got a solid DD and found the shady deals going on and everyone got on bandwagon? 

Still figuring out the calls and options part also but I guess Investopedia will help me with that.

Sorry, this is not about lending your Stonks. This is about you not being able to allow your account to be held as pawn because you owe money.

Not a lawyer. No legal consulting here. Just somebody who got this kind of stuff on his desk at a financial institution - usually from our IRS chasing tax debtors.

&#x200B;

Sorry, aber das bezieht sich mE nicht auf den Verleih von Aktien durch den Broker, sondern schränkt Dich ein. Du kannst das Konto nicht als Sicherheit verpfänden.

 Wäre also analog Punkt 7 der AGB zu lesen:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

[https://smartbroker.de/agb.php](https://smartbroker.de/agb.php)

7. Abtretungsverbot

Der Kunde kann Ansprüche, die ihm aus der Geschäftsbeziehung mit der             wallstreet:online capital AG zustehen (einschließlich Schadensersatzansprüche), nur mit Zustimmung der             wallstreet:online capital AG an Dritte abtreten.          \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ich bin kein Anwalt. Dies ist keine Rechtsberatung. Aber ich hab schon Pfändungs- und Überweisungsbeschlüsse des Finanzamtes gegen Kontoinhaber ausgeführt. Und in Arbeitsverträgen steht das auch ähnlich. Wenn also eine Pfändung kommt (z.B. vom Finanzamt oder dem Gerichtsvollzieher) bist Du vertragsbrüchig und hast für eventuellen Schäden aufzukommen. Und umgekehrt ist die Bank aus dem Schneider, wenn sie Deine Aktien ""gefühlt unter Wert"" verscherbelt, um den ""PfÜb"" zu bedienen. 

&#x200B;

Ich glaub nicht, dass [Aktien.net](https://Aktien.net) da einen Fachanwalt beim Test dabei hatte. Der kostet Geld und sagt möglichst wenig, kennt auch diese spezielle Feld ""PfÜb"" eher selten.

That is - unless they create some new stock to sell to the hedgies. That would probably ensure a massive base of haters leaving bad comments on whatever they do - be it good or not.

So this is an honest question that I can't grapple around: how can I square the fact that nobody goes to the brick-and-mortar stored to buy games anymore with what's happening to the GameStop stock? But also, once the price of shares rises substantially, what is to stop the company leadership from selling the shares of the firm to a different outfit like BestBuy at a discount, and simply cashing out to move on to bigger things? And what's so great about the GameStop fundamentals that warrants this level of investment?

If you give up and sell your stock now, we lose and the hedge fund wins. Don’t waste the previous effort of bruh here. Strong buy and strong hold.

Please note that it takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover the stock. No fear. Bruh! Disregard what the mainstream media and BS said, and simply buy and strong hold GME. YOLO! Keep chasing our dream. Bring GME to moon or even Mars.

If your broker limits buying GME, please don’t give up and try buying from Sofi and Tradestation. You may contact your account manager of Tradestation for help if you have difficulties of buying GME.

I love you all. Love from Hong Kong.

**Get ready for $GME FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.**

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your $GME shares.

ALWAYS check the up/downvote ratio and read the comments before getting swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh how desperate they now have become.

They think the longer they do that, the lower our PT will be because we will begin to think the squeeze isn’t coming.

 But as the price is 🚀 they are also putting in new shorts (including new people doing the same). rationally, which we know nothing about, it’s a sound bet at this point, but we hold all the 🍌.

1355,glgw0az,t3_l8s98l," A COMPLETE explanation of EVERYTHING. This sums up everything. SHARE. LIKE.  


What is short selling:  


Shorting, or short-selling, is when an investor, (hedge fund) borrows shares (from a broker), and immediately sells them, hoping he or she can scoop them up later, (buy them back), at a lower price.  


In short selling, a position is opened by borrowing shares of a stock (borrowing from a broker Like Robin hood etc.) or other asset that the investor (hedge fund manager) believes will decrease in value by a set future date—>the expiration date. The investor (hedge fund manager) then sells these borrowed shares to buyers willing to pay the market price. Before the borrowed shares must be returned, the trader is betting that the price will continue to decline and they can purchase them at a lower cost.  


Brokers (Robinhood, Webull, etc) get paid interest on those shares they lent to the investor (hedge funds) for the duration the investor holds those borrowed funds. The lender (broker > RH or Webull etc.) can request that the investor (hedge fund) return the shares whenever they want. They will typically do this when they see a massive spike in the share price. They can ask the investor (hedge fund) to return the shares at any time, whether it is a loss, or a gain for them. The investor (hedge fund) can continue to ""double down"" and borrow shares, provided the broker (RH etc) allows them to. They are typically pal's and work together behind the scenes (hence share purchase restrictions....and why you need to avoid these platforms.)  


What happens if the price goes down:  


If the price goes down below the price set at the expiration date, the Hedge Fund will make profits by the difference. Ex: Friday was $8.63. If the price closed at $1.63 on Friday, the hedge fund would have made a profit of $7/share that they shorted. This is why you see hedge funds act on negative news, or create negative news, to drive share prices down - so they profit. This is what WE are sick and tired of.  


If the price goes up:  


If the price goes up, the lender (Broker / RH etc) can ask the investor (hedge fund) to return the shares at a loss. The investor (hedge fund) will have to pay the lender the difference in price between the shorted price and the current market price. Example: Friday closed at $13.26. Expiration price was $8.63. The investor (hedge fund) could either buy as much as they can now and return the shares at the difference (loss) of $4.63 per share, or they can continue to short - provided the lender has not requested they return the borrowed shares. This is where the waiting game comes in. They may not want to pay that loss if they feel they can continue to short and believe they can manipulate the price down - this is where their scare tactics and selling pressure come into play.  


Remember - you (we) own the shares they need to desperately buy. If they scare you into selling, this gives them the opportunity to buy your shares at a much lower price than what they would have to if we hold them and refuse to sell them at that lower price they've manipulated it through.  


How do hedge funds manipulate share prices or apply selling pressure: (watch the video to understand)  


VIDEO: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4)  


Warning, watching this video may infuriate you even more as you see how these guys manipulate to take the average Joe's money.  


\- they make the ""impression"" the stock is down and instill fear.... fear of losing your hard earned money. This will make you sell (they win).  


So what do we do:  


\- buy.  
\- hold.  
\- buy more.  


What will the share price jump to?  


Nobody can determine this or know this. Stop asking. What is the potential? The potential is indefinite, technically speaking. Technically, their exposure is indefinite but unlikely.  
Will we see $20, $40, $60, $100, $200, $300, $500 ?  
The quick answer is yes - that is possible. What does it depend on? It depends on us buying the shares, owning the shares, and holding the shares. If you sell them at $15, then they will buy them and that will be the price of the share. If you hold, and nobody sells until $100, then the price of the share will be $100. If everyone HOLDS and refuses to sell until $200, the price will then be $200 as someone agrees to sell for $300.  


This is why it's important to hold. Buy, and hold. Do not sell.  


How long will this take:  
Options are expiring next week again. As options expire, hedge fund investors have increased pressure to buy back shares (cover). When they buy back shares, this creates an ongoing never ending effect of the price going up. The more the price goes up, the more pressure they get to buy back quicker, on and on. Keep in mind - the longer this goes on, the more interest they are paying on those shares. They will eventually crack and have to pay through the nose. I hope this helps everyone.",6,wallstreetbets,1612089269.0,1612031762.0

1365,gleai9v,t3_l8s98l," Two weeks ago I was telling my wife that no matter what I to improve life I could never earn a million dollars. My mind has changed over the last couple days watching the GME/AMC phenomenon. Although I got behind the movement a little too late and was restricted in the amount of shares I could purchase by the manipulators to make that million, I see how easy it can happen for me. A million dollars is attainable for anyone willing to dive in and it doesn't require a great sum of money or an extensive education. AMC/GME is the first step to enriching my life.

I dropped about 20k total to get this house. 
On one hand I'm glad because I'll have a place of my own and a roof over my head... but on the other, Holly shit... if I just lived in my truck for a bit I may have been able to buy a house and pay my student loans all outright. Lol oh well.

Editting since this post has visibility:
**DONT SELL ON RH THINKING YOU CAN REBUY WITH NEW MONeY ON OTHER PLACES. It wont work out b/c of the timing of the orders. They play a fuck load of games with timing it. Basically RH sells your order info to Citadel .5 seconds before it executes. This makes it so they can do some crazy super computer magic and make trades favorable to them in that .5 seconds and have it execute before yours. If this happens, they will just trade the stocks back and forth and tank the price. Its fucked up**

40 million shorted (prob not by the same hedgefund) times what they buy it back at (lets say average 600$) 

20 million shares at 600$ is 12 billion dollars. That would destroy them kindaish. But if the price goes higher so will our sell limits. Lets say we go to 800$ steady price on monday or tuesday with no spike and no bs trickery. 

Then we probably sell for 1200 average. Maybe even 3000. 

24-60 billion dollars. 

PLUS them buying back raises the price. Buying back 20 million shares would absolutely spike the price. So lets assume a 50BN dollar loss on their part. 

But if the spike doesnt happen, and we end up buying 90% of the total shares and NEVER sell. Then we completely fuck the hedgefunds by probably 100 BN plus.

Let’s say you have $1000 in the bank and you have to buy a car. Like it’s happening, you don’t have a choice. 

There’s only one car for sale, it’s a 1992 civic. You’re thinking “this thing is close to 30 years old I’m not paying them any more than $200 for it. 

Then someone else comes along and shows interest. You know you have to buy it, you can’t let someone else, but the current owner has raised the price to $500.

You’re sitting there thinking “fuck me if I’m paying this douche canoe $300 more than it was last week. He’ll come down. 

Then more come along, and two more people show interest and now the price is $900.

Can you afford it? Yes. 

But you only have $1000 and god damn it you don’t want to! 

Now it’s 3 more people come in, and suddenly it’s $1400.

You can no longer afford it and you can no longer complete your objective.
