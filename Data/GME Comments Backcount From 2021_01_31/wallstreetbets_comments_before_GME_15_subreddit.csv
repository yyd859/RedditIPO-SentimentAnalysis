53,glfk7td,t3_l90vmv,"**My Uncle, the Farmer is Exactly Like Gamestop**

My uncle was at one time a very successful farmer.  However, several years ago, things took a bad turn.  My uncle developed health problems that gradually got worse.  By the time the doctors came up with a good diagnosis, my uncle was struggling financially. 

To make matters worse, my uncle’s piece of crap neighbor heard of the trouble my uncle was experiencing.  Instead of lending a hand to help out on the farm, that guy took out a life insurance policy on my uncle!   He figured not only could he end up with my uncle’s farm, he could make a profit at the expense of my uncle’s demise. 

This utter lack of human compassion did not stop there.  That same neighbor started contacting other neighbors, letting them know that they could also take out a life insurance policy on my uncle.  Most declined, but some joined in.  Then, all of those lowlifes hoping my uncle would go ahead and die, went to the bank and told the bankers that my uncle would soon be dead.  As a result, the bankers refused to loan my uncle desperately needed money that would help him get medical treatments and continue farming operations.

As a result, nobody who was in a position to help my uncle would.  Those who wanted to didn’t have the money to help with his treatments and they were afraid to go against the (evil) landowners who all hoped to profit off of my uncles death.

Well, I’m glad to say that today, things have changed.  I was just a boy when all of this started, but over the years I and my friends have saved up a fair amount of money.  We went to the bank and bought back my uncle’s mortgage on the farm. We provided the money needed to help cure my uncle’s illness.  It even looks like the farm has promise of once again being a prosperous enterprise.  To make things even better, as a result of my uncle’s good fortune, he has included each of us in sharing the profits from his farm.

But now we have another problem.  The cruel landowners who took out life insurance policies on my uncle now realize that they are not going to profit off of his death and won't be able to divide up his farm among themselves. And they are outraged!  At this very moment, they are colluding  with  the town’s sheriff to say that the money we pooled to help my uncle should not be accepted and that the farm isn’t worth what we paid because my uncle was supposed to die and let the farm become  worthless.

We need your help!

Does any of this sound fair to you?  Of course not.

I don’t have an uncle.  This story is about Gamestop.  The hedge funds spotted a struggling business and made bets against it.  This made it even harder for the business to get necessary funding to transform itself.  All of you are me and my friends.  You saw a business that others have bet against and have provided the funding, even more than is needed, to turn everything around.

Now, the hedge funds are crying foul.  They don’t like it that you decided to go against their evil deeds and they devising ways to force the sheriff to halt your payment to the bank.  They are succeeding with some firms (you know who they are). 

The world is watching.

Shorts down -$19.75B in 2021 mark-to-market losses; down -$7.83B on today's +70% move.

The drop in shorts took place on Thursday when they limited buying and drove the price down.However is seem NEW shorts have taken up a new position, from what I’ve read the “new” shorts come with a higher interest rate of above 80% (don’t know if anyone can confirm) Since the price bounced back I imagine that had to fucking hurt!

That said, a counter argument. I agree with you that Melvin isn’t the only HF shorting this thing, and I’m also willing to bet they did cover their lowest shorts when retail trading was almost completely suspended, but I’m almost certain there are a good amount of other big players playing the same game as the retail investors. If that weren’t the case, there’s no way GME would’ve closed above $320 on Friday when many retail brokers were restricting transactions.

It was down to like $220 not long before the end of the day, then steadily and quickly climbed way back up. Retail investors buying 1 share at a time weren’t doing this.

That makes me think that there are people (and/or hedge funds) with serious money who are also pushing for the price to go up and who will be fighting tooth and nail to make that happen so they can profit alongside the common people throwing a few thousands at the stock.

Will that actually happen and will the price climb to $500, $1k, $10k, $42069? I have no idea, but I’m confident we’re not the only ones hoping and fighting for that to happen.",30,wallstreetbets,1612057975.0,1612055638.0

 In addition to what you're saying, it's not only the hedge funds or brokers you worry about because they can only do but so much now. You have to remember people investing in GME as well. The many people that caught it at $19 and lower will probably start selling at $600-$800(or maybe 1K) if they have the minimum of 100-200 shares. They're the foundation that propelled GME and are sitting on about 30-60K right now already. I see many brazen comments that demean people who have ""paper hands"" and meme-ing about serious money. But I'm pretty sure once those who got it for the low secure 6 figures worth, they'll sell and GME will go down. I know I'm not everyone but that's 100% what I would do. $10,000-$20,000 alone can change your life or be useful somehow; especially if you're the average Joe.

Exactly what I've been saying within my friend group. Whilst it is amazing that GME has been able to accomplish what it has, there are only so many retail investors looking to buy in, and they only have a certain amount of money.

There are two parts to trading, knowing when to buy and knowing when to sell. All these new people to the stock market don't understand the second part. Whilst it might keep rising for a bit, the hype will eventually die and people will be left bag holding at the top, it's just the way the market works, it cannot rise indefinitely as much as we want it to.

404,glfqq0e,t1_glfoz5f,"External parties can't force or ask GameStop to issue more shares at current prices. But investors can pressure them to do so, especially if investors are large (e.g. Ryan Cohen).

GME should actually issue shares at current prices, even if they can't take advantage of doing so personally, but they should make the company's cash reserves better so they can focus on future growth.... But guess what?

When (and of course, IF) they issue more shares, a few things will happen;

1. Shorts who initiated positions when the stock price was low will get to close them at a lower price than now (because issuing shares will dilute stock price and thus cause a fall). They will still be at a loss, but at a relatively smaller loss than now.
2. And, not only that, shorts who initiated positions at higher prices (like current levels) will get to take home profits upon price drop. The retailers will get hurt by this.
3. Price drops may actually cause a further domino effect and scare retails into selling their positions. Again, WSB is confident this won't happen, but I'd like to think 1000 heads can't all be thinking the same thing at all times... So it will only take a few people to ruin the party for everyone. The question is, who's gonna call it a night and walk away from the table while they're ahead.
4. Of course, issuing of new shares may actually hinder the chances of a significant squeeze... but I think either Ryan Cohen has thought about this, or the management has thought about this. Issuing shares only hurts investors with high entry points.

But, whatever happens, if shares are issued, the stock won't be returning back to single digits because it won't justify company valuation given the new high level of cash on hand. If it does and starts trading at a discount, it's time to pick up shares without questions asked as the book value per share would be much higher than the market value.

Plus, the company prospects would look better as they may be able to address other opportunities relating to e-sports or online games. Brick and mortar will not be sustainable in the long run, and everyone knows that. Even Ryan Cohen sent letters to the GME board to begin thinking of a more online future, or one more intertwined with the future of gaming.",3,wallstreetbets,1612060001.0,1612055638.0

488,glfiu7x,t3_l90txk,"Let's be part of history!!! 

For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

572,glfjot1,t3_l90q28,"Here is my monkey-brained idea.

Game Stop was previously getting slaughtered because of the overall decline in brick-and-mortar stores. Most people do their shopping online for everything. Then with the release of the next generation consoles it took another hit, when the consoles decided to offer versions where there isn't even a slot for physical disks. So this leaves Game Stop being referred to now as Blockbuster, a company that didn't 'keep up with the times'.

This is where they need to do bold innovation.

Game Stop needs to become the first game subscription gaming service where a console or PC is not required at all, and its app comes pre-loaded on smart TVs like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, etc. My idea works in two ways.

1. The actual 'gaming' side of it will be through a blue-tooth controller that connects to your smart TV rather than to the console. This is how you will play games/ navigate the menu.
2. Game Stop needs to handle all of the gaming processing requirements from their end, and stream the content to your TV. PS Now is a lower-tier version of this, with its game streaming using your consoles processing power.

Now where the value proposition comes in is that Game Stop with its new found wealth needs to become what it was in the brick and mortar stores, a one-stop game shop. It needs to get licensing to build the largest collection of games out of any platform for gamers to have access to. I am talking as many games from all platforms from the Commodore 64 to PS5.

Why would a gamer want this? Many reasons, but the few that comes to mind are this. You will never have to buy another console again, ever. EVER. All the processing will be handled on Game Stop's end. Your only upfront cost will be the Game Stop controller, and your TV. By having it as a subscription service you will provide more entertainment-to-dollar than buying games directly. If the streaming service were comparable to PS Now, you would pay 45 Euro per year (or USD Equivalent) and that is it. You won't have to buy a new $500+ console every decade. This also means that 'console' gaming can improve lock-step with technology, rather than in large leaps every new console. Why? Because Gamestop will handle the processing.

Alternative idea:

Have all of this but get Elon Musk onboard to include it as a service bundled with his new internet service. Unlimited gaming anywhere on the planet, streamed to your TV, with only a subscription and controller required. No console ever again.

But then again, maybe I am just retarded.

tl;dr

Gamestop needs to become a subscription service with the largest gaming library on the planet. It should only require you buy a controller that connects to your smart tv, and never buy a console again. Games on the system can improve inline with new technology, as all processing will be handled on Game Stop's end, and streamed directly to you.

1) Build up and focus on a cloud service for distributing games across all platforms. Pretty much become a universal Steam. Not sure if platforms like PS and Xbox even have a business need for this, but maybe it would help them cut costs on their online stores.

2) Also start a subscription service for games similar to Xbox's GamePass. Where you can have access to a collection of games that changes every month or two.

You highlighted:

Fuck aggressive sales pitches, why? Lead customers to things they like and let them make their own decisions. Build resources for employees to understand broader demographics of games/users to help them ask the customer what they want.

Trade-ins are hard for customers. Presumably trade-ins are free money like any other industry, re-evaluate cost analysis for pricing. Is there a way to DCA trade-ins to make it flatter, or maybe look at it from an environmental perspective.. is this reducing Gamestop's footprint by recycling game sales? Give buyers credit due to this savings.

Users don't mind memberships but if they're looking out to buy specific games, a membership isn't valuable to them. If you have memberships create VALUE OUT OF THEM. If customers aren't buying memberships organically THEY'RE NOT VALUABLE. Look at Apple's service bundling. Gamestop membership should bundle a bunch of individual memberships: 1) favorable priced game trading/trade-in 2) LAN or trading card gaming table usage 3) exclusive minifigs skins whatever 4) game subscriptions a la xbox but over multiple ecosystems 5) family exclusive content services that households can play together but also with other households etc

Don't hire sale reps, hire ""mentors"", that help find the perfect games to match a kids interest AND needs. 

My brother only learned to read thanks to FFvii. My sons have various emotional needs from their bio mom, most mainstream games, and even game room chat (again mentioned by u, and I fall victim to with CODBO and II) is all counter productive to what my kids need. But I also cannot insulate them from our digital world because it will set them back as adults. Mentors could navigate the endless titles, renew interest in GOTY like little big planet (personal fav) and engage kids in STEM and the like. In fact, my middle son would kill for the chance to take the Xbox apart, we finally gave him the old desktop at one point with a screwdriver. 

Last argument on this clubhouse feel tho, there is not one parent out there that wouldn't pay a small fee for 4 hours of free time a week while their kids enjoy learning something. No joke.

So when a new game is released, they(Game development companies) can release and update it on GamestopCloudDrive rather than Microsoft and Sony needing to bother with it. It also could allow users to have a single long lasting service to manage their games and licenses and ownership to them, rather than loosing them when they get a new gen console or Live account for that platform. Something PC users enjoy today, with being able to enjoy games they buy on steam forever, regardless of what PC they have or are using.

First: Hold.  
Second: Don't sell your GME for any other stock until AFTER the squeeze is squoze!  
Third: SLV will never crash the silver market.

But this doesn't change the fact that silver is the most manipulated, artificially shorted commodity, perhaps thing, in existence. With infinite potential value, GME could technically crash large segments of the financial market. If silver goes up, it **Will** crash the entire global market, multiple currencies worldwide, and cause the actual financial apocalypse. To be honest, I'm not even sure I would want WSB to move there next if they could and I got to choose.  However, after GME explodes, we just might have enough retail capital in the hands of crazy yolo bastards to make waves. 

It would almost certainly need to be through the futures market, and instead of memeing about oil guy squirming his way out of taking delivery, people would need to take delivery intentionally.  Silver is kept down because more paper contracts are being sold than large institutions have actual metal. The only way to squeeze that system is to actually take so much silver out that there is a failure to deliver, or they will just short and short and short with contracts pulled from their ass forever.

I might write a proper DD about silver myself at some point after GME dies down. I honestly really doubt institutions are shilling for it compared to just individual silver bugs shilling on their own. If it actually got hit, it would bite wallstreet in the ass so hard that it wouldn't just make history books, it would make people start burning the history books for warmth after the lights go off. There are people long in silver though who have been waiting actual decades for that squeeze to happen. Take somebody holding that long for a squeeze seeing this all happening on the news and it's no wonder they hopped over to try and steal GME's thunder for their own play.

I also actually kind of like Peter Schiff, but he does get full of himself, and he clearly has not done the homework on what's going on here. Arrogance, tunnel vision, and not understanding the short squeeze mechanics brought those comments out. Shook my head when I heard him talking about things.

773,glfilvw,t3_l90om0,"My story of silver goes back to the 2008 financial crisis.  It is was first spurted my drive to protect myself from the mess the bankers, political puppets, Federal Reserve, and politicians were creating.  A crisis historically weeds out bad players, players that make mistakes.  They should be left to go bust and let those who were disciplined take over.  But the suits got their bailouts at the expense of the US taxpayer.  Then the Federal Reserve big wigs spent years getting praised, like Bernanke being posed as a hero on the cover of the Atlantic.  That was so disgusting.  That continued with Yellen who after the completion of her term gets fees to make speeches from the likes of Citadel.  The only way you get paid such egregious fees from suits is because you did them a favor at some point and that’s their way of paying you back, quid pro quo.  All the while the money supply has been shooting up, and in particular, this year it has gone parabolic.  But government and the financial puffer tv networks come up with all sorts of apologist excuses, that the new money is parked and frozen as reserves at banks, that there is no inflation, and the suits even went as far as to manipulate the price of paper gold and silver for years.  The same apologists spent so much effort saying there was no manipulation when cascades of sell orders would get poured into the thinnest part of the trading day and night on the futures market.  Eventually the suits were charged with manipulation, but the fines are outrageously low.  As they say, a wrist slap.  

Let’s forget the silver and gold paper manipulation for a second.  I want to focus on inflation and the overwhelming efforts of the government and suits to understate it in every way possible.  I think the one of the only few places you see no inflation and even deflation is for things like flat screen TVs.  Unfortunately, we can’t eat TVs or live in TVs.  It is in the government’s best interest to understate inflation as much as possible, it minimizes their fixed payment obligations, so they only make small upward adjustments to them every year (cost of living adjustments), instead of an appropriate adjustment measured by true inflation.  There are many numerical computational tricks the BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates inflation) use to understate inflation.  These are arbitrary examples, but I hope you get the point.  If the price of steak goes up, the BLS assumes you will substitute steak consumption by some cheaper meat or who knows what else.  They also make assumptions about many products whose price increases.  They make “hedonic adjustments” to say that the price increase gets offset in real terms because the product has actually gone up in quality.  That’s true for things like TVs and PCs, but not for most things.  Let’s also focus on some tricks implemented by Corporate American suits to help explain how they facilitate the rigging of inflation numbers.  I’ll focus on the grocery market, but it happens everywhere in the economy.  The term that I began to see coined at least 5-6 years ago was “shrinkflation”.  What this means is let’s say in a bag of potato chips, they’ll use less chips in the bag so it actually weights less but the price is the same.  Our government and others mentioned above will tell you there is no inflation.  To them the price stayed the same.  They are doing this with everything including toilet paper.  You get less sheets now in toilet paper than you used to.  The frozen pizza is smaller and comes with less cheese.  They do this little by little every year hoping none of you notice or complain.  The other infamous trick is “new and improved formula”.  This almost certainly assures you are getting worse lower quality ingredients than you used to.  

I have to admit that for the last several years my spirits have been crushed.  I slowly stopped adding incremental positions.  At this point I’ve been laughed at for years by friends and family.

I began following wallstreetbets last year around the time Palantir got popular.  I saw you all mobilize into GME but I didn’t take action.  Slowly I began to understand your cause.  We share the same bitterness for those that burned us in 2008 by selling us out to the suits.  But your generation has been burned the worst and I sympathize with your resentment.  A glimmer of hope arose when I began to see chatter of a silver squeeze.  Gold is also manipulated but it’s far less undervalued than silver.  

I hope that this effort continues to gain momentum, but I do understand your current battle with GME so I’m not even going to tell anyone to bail on that battle to join the silver one.  It’s been over a decade war for me, so I don’t mind waiting a little longer.  But I think we’ve all reached a point where so many realize how bad the suits have screwed us all and we are tired of it.

1. Wall Street is doing everything they can to trigger a sell off and save themselves from their short positions. 🌈🐻

2. Most sensible people believe that at some point there will be a big spike at which point you should sell and then it will crash down. 📈📉

BUT HERE IS WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER SELL:

The whole reason u/deepfuckingvalue bought into $GME in the first place is because he saw how the company had the potential to come up. This got amplified when Ryan Cohen invested in GameStop with the belief that through their loyal customer base they could move online and become like the Amazon of video games. 

Then thanks to all of us, $GME started it’s journey to the moon (but this is just the start). On the way we picked up AMC and SAVED THEM FROM BANKRUPTCY. They were able to raise capital from all the money suddenly being thrown at them. Now times that by 1000 and that’s the 💸💸💸 GameStop can access. 

The idea for many of us has been that we squeeze the hedgies until we can land on the moon and eat tendies with Papa Elon. But the hedge funds will never believe that $GME can stay at these “insane” levels so they will never stop shorting them. They say that the valuation is completely disconnected from reality. 

Ok, now I’m going to get to the point: With all the money now available to GameStop they can LITERALLY transform into the Amazon of video games. 

I like this stock. 

Then they just split the stock 5 ways a couple times and suddenly we’re not on the moon, we’re not on Mars and we’re not even on Ur anus. We’re in a whole other GALAXY as the fundamentals somehow start to match GME’s valuation. In the meantime we get to not only save the company but do it while billionaire after billionaire cries as they sell their yachts because they tried to take on all of us retards. 

This is long play, but this can be the reality. You know activist investors? WE’RE the activist investors and we’re going to 🚀🚀🚀 into another galaxy.

Please read for yourself about how Max Keiser almost crashed JP Morgan by encouraging everyone to buy 1 physical oz of silver.
I believe this may be remembered as the single most important moment in the history of working class people, that's why I created this Reddit account and I'm posting for the first time. I want to do my part to fight for the working class.
Gold and silver are the most manipulated market in history (JP Morgan just fine $920 million for precious metals manipulation last year). 
So why should you invest?

It's simple psychology, if the people who rob you on a daily basis(banks) risk massive fines and criminal prosecution (literally get their hands dirty) trying to keep a lid on gold and silver, that shows it is a critical weakness for them.
So we know precious metals are a weakness for the banks, but what are the benefits to you as the investor? 
1) it provides a good inflation hedge over time
2) its traded/accepted worldwide as a form of money
3) Its a risk free asset (Gold is recognised as good as cash by Central banks since its been made a Tier 1 asset)

924,glgfcab,t3_l90om0,"Well, silver is being manipulated by someone; generally silver is worth 1/17 of gold.  right now it's like 1/80 gold.  so someone is manipulating it's value.  so those ""silver"" folks aren't wrong.

That said there is no easy way to invest in silver, there will be no serious up pressure on it, someone makes money from killing it's price I doubt they'll let anyone fuck with that.  Furthermore you need a LOT of money to fuck with silver values, like hundreds of millions of dollars.

If you want to put money into it after GME feel free, no amount of small investment in silver will move it's price much, being a commodity it's bought and sold in volume by weight.  furthermore it's not a finite product like stock, there is a limit to the amount of stock you can purchase, meanwhile they're always mining more silver out of the ground.

So while silver prices are being manipulated by someone, the volume and $$ involved makes GME look like a raindrop in a rainstorm.  I plan to buy some put options on silver after GME is done and my holdings in BB are done after doing more research but this is months from now when I know WHY silver is being depressed.

Step two is to buy buy buy physical silver. Not the paper crap. Preferably by the bullion from the store operated by AG. That way you increase the profits of the company you own stock in while pulling physical from the market. More profits are good for AG. Higher silver price is good for AG.

The idea I have is to buy the roll, ie short march / long september, and roll my put up to the money.  Then treat the march short as a covered put, so if it runs back down to 25 I can cover the short and close the put when I've drained enough theta to be happy, and be left holding a residual long september.

""In order for a shareholder to take delivery of the actual physical gold, he or she must be an authorized participant and deal in 100,000 share blocks. In addition, one looking to take delivery must make arrangements with their broker. That being said, a 100,000 share block at current prices equals a monetary value of approximately $12,572,000.""

So that being said, if someone is big enough to try to redeem SLV share for cash, they probably have a vested interest in not upsetting the status quo. Also why throw that much capital at it when you can just leverage yourself in the futures market? 

I personally haven't read the SLV ETF prospectus in hella long. I mean, I can't even read anymore so why bother again. Also, keep in mind the major thing in the way of a failure to deliver price spiking catastrophe is banks. Second is logistics of taking delivery. Since its actually on topic for current events, failure to deliver/Bankruptcy in financials ladder of who's problem is it now? Hedgies and stuff -> broker -> bank -> govt.
