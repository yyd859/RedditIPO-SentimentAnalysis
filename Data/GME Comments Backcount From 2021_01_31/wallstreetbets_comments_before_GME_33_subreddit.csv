If you have 50k limits & hit even 2 parked cars, you risk not having enough coverage. What does that mean? Your insurance may not be able to pay for all of the damages and the other party’s insurance can come after you and your assets for the difference if they pay for the damages, especially if they refuse to accept any low limit agreements. 

I see way too many claims where people wanted to save $10 and chose lower liability limits and were screwed. Insurance can only pay what they owe up to your limits. Raise your liability limits and if you have any assets at all (condo, house, $$$, etc.), get yourself an umbrella policy. 

**Your limits usually look like 50k/100k, 100k/250k, 250k/500k...the first # is for property damage, i.e. other cars, their rental vehicle while their car is non-drivable or being repaired, fences, yards, damaged goods in their vehicle/semi, poles, etc. The second number is for their injuries & sometimes your passenger’s injuries.",74,wallstreetbets,1612043279.0,1612041992.0

98,glev9om,t3_l8w5ez,"Also to clarify, you need to have higher limits on your auto and homeowners in order to qualify for an umbrella (at least with most major carriers) 

It's wise to update your insurance as you increase your net worth. Many never even take a second look at their insurance to understand exactly how it works or at the very least make sure you have the coverage you thought you did. Especially when you have assets, investments, nice car/house etc. you don't want to be vulnerable or get pissed that you slacked on your insurance when you actually go to use it. Go through some scenarios in your head and double check that with your agent or against the policy to CYA

TL:DR insure everything. Nobody ever complained for having too much insurance.

Honestly, the auto insurance is relatively cheap at like $1,800 per year for my wife and I. In addition, the Umbrella is like $700 more. This is totally worth it though. I literally tapped some guy’s bumper 3 years ago and he is trying to claim he had $600k worth of injuries - total BS. There was zero damage to his car and airbags didn’t deploy. Probably tapped him at less than 5 MPH. In any case I am just glad that I have 5x the coverage than is being claimed here. But when scumbags see a nice car, TSLA in my case, they and their shitbag lawyers will try to exhort you. In any case, if I only had the minimum required coverage, I would potentially have to come out of pocket for $550k (assuming his BS claim prevailed).

I then apply her CPAP machine while telling her shes beautiful and midnight I wake up and literally shovel flaming hot cheetos in her mouth.  2 AM she wants three pizzas so I cook them and feed them to her with one of those trash clamps thats like 3 feet long.  In the morning its 10 lbs of bacon and she likes it when i pour the bacon fact into a glass she can chug.

We then go clothes shopping, and I tell her she can have anything she wants that fits.  She gets winded after 5 steps so i kiss her hairy mustached lips before calling the transport company to fir her through the doors.

Then dinner time is usually whichever chinese buffet will assist her to a table.  After which i pretend to whip out my sick but after i deadlift her on to her stomach ill just use my arm and pretend its my dick.  Then the whole process repeats

Then in September a very close friend of mine passed away shoveling the snow. It hit me hard cuz he was 3 yrs younger than ME. Were it not for my mental health therapy, I don't know where I'd be right now, but I'd be missing out on this amazing event that has given me life. 

This is an amazing movement. The fact we're actually making such an impact that rich people are crumbling emotionally and losing their shit. Good. Give them more of that. Maybe mail them some McDonald's application forms and some bootstraps from which they can hang themselves with.

During the day they could give promotions to kids to come to the arcade under a program of re-socializing kids to undo the psychological damage of the lockdowns (an essential upcoming social cause). At night they could function like video game bars which have been very successful here in Chicago (a currently proven business model i.e. Emporium). AMC already has very nice movie theaters across the country, and GME already has tons of video game equipment. I personally would definitely patronize this venture repeatedly when things open up, and I think many across the country would do the same (and across the world if people could play with/against people in other countries while at these arcades).

643,glez19o,t1_glescrc,"Two people don’t own it. Not technically anyway. The person shorting borrowed it. Easiest explanation. A short borrows 1 share of someone else’s stock for a dollar and sells it. They theoretically made one dollar for now but it’s not technically really their money since they didn’t own it. Now whoever the person they sold it to has ownership. One owner. But, the short has to cover the sell at some point in time. So when the short has to cover, they buy back a single share since they sold a share that wasn’t theirs. The short wants that stock to drop between the time they sold it and when they buy it back because the money they make is based on the difference between what they sold the borrowed stock for (a dollar) and what they buy it back to return to the rightful owner for. If the stock drops to 50 cents, they made 50 cents. If it goes to 5 dollars, they are in the hole 4 bucks. If they see the price rise quickly it results in a squeeze from all of the shorts panicking to buy the stock back without incurring more losses. This is why shorting can be dangerous. While you can technically lose 100% from buying a stock if a company goes bankrupt, you can lose far more than 100% shorting a stock.",1,wallstreetbets,1612045724.0,1612041521.0
