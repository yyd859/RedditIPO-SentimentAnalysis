28,glewo8v,t3_l8wf1z,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1.	⁠Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.
2.	⁠After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.
3.	⁠Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.
4.	⁠Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.
5.	⁠We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.
6.	⁠If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.
7.	⁠If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.
8.	⁠If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.
9.	⁠It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

This came as Robinhood and other brokers imposed limits on share buying by RI. I bet new entrants to the short side did the maths and figure it'll be harder to pull off the gamma squeeze with these limits. 

At the same time FT reported that the squeeze up until now has led HF unwind their long potions to cover up the shorts that led to major declines in the indices. If the squeeze continues there'll inevitably be more blood, hence more unwinding of long positions, and greater declines in broader indices. This spells pain for a LOT of people invested on the long side. WSB stocks have been the only ones that benefited recently, and one can bet this will upset more people. I think that to stabilise the market all brokerages will be required to limit buys on WSB stocks. While the shorts can load up on new bets, as we know.

51,gley02s,t3_l8wf1z,"I ran some retardation through Excel. Correct me where I am wrong. Not FA, do your own DD. Posted this a bunch, you can find rebuttals all over.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1. most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @ 250+
2. covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3. if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4. this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5. conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion: Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher. All paperhands, you are safe to hold, even if it dips all the way down to 1$, three times.

The fact you post this all over the place makes me think you're trying to convince people 822 is the top so they sell. I'd expect the next jump to be up to 800s based on the aforementioned self-similarity. It does no good to make people think the shorters have covered in the event the price goes 800+, its just the mathematical principals at play.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1. most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @ 250+
2. covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3. if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4. this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5. conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion: Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher. All paperhands, you are safe to hold, even if it dips all the way down to 1$, three times. Just hold.

If you can't watch your account, you should not be in such a risky position. You can do a few things.

* Sell GME. I recommend this for your situation because you literally can't watch the market. I'll get downvotes for even suggesting this but that's my advice.

* Put a stop loss order, which will cause you to sell at a big dip or market sell after a squeeze. You also have to trust your broker to not shit the bed when the time comes. This is not a great idea but it's an option.

* Hold GME, understanding that ""having the option to sell during the short squeeze"" is priced into the current price. If you aren't here for the next couple days, you're throwing away that value. Think of it like theta decay.",1,wallstreetbets,1612042773.0,1612042537.0

262,glfoe69,t3_l8w9z8,"MAC has been operating with profitability this year, rent collections are stabilizing, they have not had to spend down there cash. Note: Most of MAC’s debt is recourse debt with mortgages tied to specific properties, when these come due no one expects them to be paid off. Macerich and the lender cannot agree on new terms for a next mortgage, MAC can simply find a new lender or hand over the keys to the property. Most likely they will continue to negotiate a next mortgage when circumstances post-pandemic are clear. MAC has $650 million of liquidity (same amount in ‘07-‘08), that includes $630 million of cash and $20 million in credit. Class A malls will be here to survive, the pandemic has placed a psychological shift in consumer spending it is evident. MAC is here to stay and adapt. Spread this knowledge, MAC and the retail apocalypse- remember Wall Street and Carl Ichan benefited handsomely by shorting commercial mortgage back securities in the 6&7 level tranches last year. There bet paid off, our bet will pay off with patience and understanding what you own. My bet is on supporting retail and the little guy. As a contrarian investor, eyeing up a short volume of 80,670,000 shares and an average volume of 9,963,000. BlackRock has a 14% stake in Macerich and increased position recently. I don’t know about you fellas, this is icing on the cake for us. The cherry on top will be the squeeze that will take place, GME traded at all time highs but with enough momentum/support the squeeze paid off. All of Wall Street and the public know which top 10 equites are being shorted, luckily for us Macerich is on that list. Let’s keep the momentum, let’s spread the wealth of knowledge.

It’s happening already. This is a great company. SPG tried buying MAC out at $96/share a few years ago because they so badly wanted the retail space. Flagship malls, huge short interest, low cost of entry right now, fair market value across all platforms is $32 and up, currently trading at $17 though because of the assholes shorting it to fucking hell.

MAC is a good one, again I’m fully fucking loaded with GME shares at $270 avg, but I also am fully fucking loaded with MAC. It’s a good one.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1. most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @ 250+
2. covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3. if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4. this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5. conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion: Buy GME. Hold GME. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher. All paperhands, you are safe to hold, even if it dips all the way down to 1$, three times.

What is the current short interest in AMC?

Various sources have vastly different figures...Unless I am reading incorrectly, it looks like some hedge funds/institutions have closed their short positions since the overall short % is down.

Yahoo Finance say the short interest is 37.24%.

Finviz say 41.91%.

Highshortinterest say 78.97%.

Am I comparing like for like? Or does this feel off...

My options were:

Hold on robinhood - or in other words continue waiting for them fuck us even harder than they already have. I wouldn't be surprised if they won't let people cash out when it's time because they lack the liquidity.

Sell - do I even have to say why this isn't a good option?

Transfer - maybe I miss the squeeze. But this is no longer about the money. This is about sending a message. I barely have $500 invested so my ""loss"" is pretty minimal.

735,gletkd1,t3_l8w98a,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1.	⁠⁠Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.
2.	⁠⁠After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.
3.	⁠⁠Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.
4.	⁠⁠Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.
5.	⁠⁠We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.
6.	⁠⁠If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.
7.	⁠⁠If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.
8.	⁠⁠If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.
9.	⁠⁠It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.
10.	⁠Keep in mind during this to help those around you. Be different then the greedy bastards. Look for ways you can donate to local charities that are in need. HOLD... but also think about positives ways you can make a real difference.

It's all good for the hedgie funds to make their plans

 fuk those paper people we are diamond hands

It's okay for the hedgies to make money in the billions

But it's not okay 4 Diamond hands to make millions

They steal from the poor to give to the rich

But when the poor make money back they all complain and they bitch
How fair is it to short 150% of the shares

And then when WSB comes everybody cares

In 2008 they stole our jobs and our house

In 2021 but those hedgies it's the time of the mouse

The little guy, the amc, the gamestop

When they took our money where was the sec cop

Robinhood You sell us 1 share while the hedges buy all

Cuz u bitches loves shorts, we love the call

So In summation, for decades you steal our home, cars

But I heard that when VW did its thing, it was at some level high enough to make it the biggest market cap company, for the better part of a whole day. That said, it could take the form of a straight up run-up. If some big short gets margin called and their broker snarfs up anything and everything on the book, they'll buy whatever orders are out there, from low to high.

First, the funds go under—they liquidate all their assets, but in the event that they don't cover, then I believe the ones that loaned them the money are on the hook, and if those guys can't pay, the bank snakes have to fork over some cash, and they hate when that happens.

I think what's nice is that there's something called ""failure to deliver"" laws which used to be a way to make sure the plebs always settled up. I don't think they expected we could ever use the uno reverse card on them.

Something that hopefully lasts. Like an automatic watch, or a nice camera, or a guitar. Something that when you look at it, you will be reminded back to this time.

I once saw a GREAT reddit post about what to do once you come into a large some of money. The most important thing you can do is to protect yourself. Not so much from potential losses but from the people in and around your life. People will come out of the wood working in an effort to get a piece of it. Most people dont have the personal infrastructure to handle more than perhaps $100k and a lot of people will be walking on Mars with much more than that. This post may be in reference to someone winning the Mega Millions or Powerball but the principals are still the same. Protect yourself.

A Big Firm that knows their shit and doesn't give a fuck about the people in your local town. They are going to act as your air bag from the wave of people looking for their piece. Then set enough aside to give yourself a long term safety net. Not all the new people here are going to turn around and yolo everything away. Put it away someplace to keep the hedge fund fucks away from it. And considering the amount of media coverage this is getting, keep your mouth shut.

1256,gletucw,t3_l8w6kh,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1.	⁠⁠Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.
2.	⁠⁠After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.
3.	⁠⁠Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.
4.	⁠⁠Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.
5.	⁠⁠We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.
6.	⁠⁠If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.
7.	⁠⁠If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.
8.	⁠⁠If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.
9.	⁠⁠It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.
10.	⁠Keep in mind during this to help those around you. Be different then the greedy bastards. Look for ways you can donate to local charities that are in need. HOLD... but also think about positives ways you can make a real difference.

Then this hedge funds, instead of taking an L, decided to say we were dumb and the stock was actually worth 20$. Gamma squezee happened, stock went bonkers cause they had to cover up and went to 120.
