1,glfj1wk,t3_l90l3c,"**THE TRUE STORY ABOUT BLACKBERRY:**

Another top tech stock is **BlackBerry** (TSX:BB)(NYSE:BB). This used to be a hardware business, but it’s completely reinvented itself as a cybersecurity software company.

Cybersecurity will be one of the most important industries over the next decade. Billions of new devices are connected to the internet each year. All of these endpoints are vulnerable to hacking. BlackBerry already has an impressive product portfolio, including its Cylance division which uses artificial intelligence to block attacks before they occur.

Luckily for you, the market hasn’t noticed BlackBerry’s pivot. The stock trades at an 80% discount to many of its cybersecurity peers. Add some organic growth to that valuation discount and you easily wind up with a 1,000% upside tech stock.

Hi, Millennial Here! I have some investing experience, but not a lot. Need a bit of guidance. I’m new to this movement, just heard about it a couple days ago and wondered if I was too late to the game. Assuming I only have about 5K to invest, is it worth at this point to get involved? Am I too late to see any real return? Should I throw everything into $GME? Divide it between $GME/$AMC or others? Should I make my purchase tonight or wait until Monday morning? How does that work? I’ve heard of new shares opening up Monday?

""In virtually all cases, when a brokerage firm ceases to operate,  customer assets are safe and typically are transferred in an orderly  fashion to another registered brokerage firm. Multiple layers of  protection safeguard investor assets. For example, registered brokerage  firms must keep their customers' securities and cash segregated from  their own so that, even if a firm fails, its customers' assets will be  safe. Brokerage firms are also required to meet minimum net capital  requirements to reduce the likelihood of insolvency, and to be members  of the [Securities Investor Protection Corp (SIPC)](http://www.sipc.org/),  which protects customer securities accounts up to $500,000. SIPC  protection comes into play in those rare cases of firm failure where  customer assets are missing because of theft or fraud.

...When a  brokerage firm self-liquidates, securities regulators, including the  SEC and FINRA, work with the firm to make sure that customer accounts  are protected and that customer assets are transferred in an orderly  fashion to one or more SIPC-protected brokerage firms.""

It sounds like plan A is usually to transfer assets to another broker. And if that fails, then SIPC insurance kicks in. At least that's how I understand it",1,wallstreetbets,1612056339.0,1612054688.0

519,glgyy80,t1_glflc88,"IB is out to fuck us over. You can watch the CEO of IB give that shady interview on CNBC where he admits to stop trading with GME to protect themself and he says that he won't allow the trading till the price drops to 17$. But maybe the coke wore off and he realized he admitted to a lot of crimes on national TV so that's why we can buy GME and AMC again on Trading212 and any other IB subsidiary.  
Trading212 has terrible execution times. Multiply times trading212 needed 3 to 5min to execute a order that lost me somewhere between 20 to 100$.  
Not to mention at market opens you never can get a fill right away. If you are serious about trading move away from Trading212. If you invest long term and don't play against them Trading212 is fine.  
If you ask me Trading212 is just like RH they lend your shares without asking you and selling our data just like RH. I'm moving away asap when this is over!",2,wallstreetbets,1612092182.0,1612054291.0

It is not based on fundamentals, it is based on flock mentality. Which is very common in the stock market. So big finance will always say it is a bubble, it will crash. But they are talking about the fundamentals, not momentum. Now, every small time investor wants to own GME. As long as that momentum remains, the stock will rise or stay. Personally I bought the share. But many bought call options. I can explain the implications of options later, if you will. But as long as the pressure is on, the stock will rise/stay.",1,wallstreetbets,1612058646.0,1612054291.0
