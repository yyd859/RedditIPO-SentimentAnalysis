This was tweeted on the SEC education twitter then retweeted by a reporter Leslie Picker, who added a ""Subtle, SEC"" to her retweet because, if you look through this it contains a few little nuggets like this one that lead me to believe they aren't only talking to retail investors:

""Short sales can expose an investor to the possibility of **unlimited losses**, since a stock can theoretically keep rising indefinitely."" 

[https://twitter.com/LesliePicker/status/1355319136046505984](https://twitter.com/LesliePicker/status/1355319136046505984)

Further Leslie's tweet was retweeted by S3 Partners who has been an ally in getting out up to date information about the short float.

If you owned shares in Melvin, they would be worthless after a bankruptcy. And, indeed, Melvin would not be covering their positions if they went bankrupt. However, there is a long chain of under-writing when it comes to covering the positions of a company, from the company, through the various financial institutions under-writing them, to the banks under writing *them*, and ultimately in the US to the FDIC under-writing the banks. The idea was specifically to give confidence that so long as a company *you invested in* didn't go bankrupt, you would get paid what you were owed by someone.

634,gleal9p,t3_l8st50," 

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

Now, the short is not set at $0 and the price will surely go up as they try to cover the the squeeze by buying shares.  However, at the $300M per day cost, they could lose the same amount, the $65B, in 215 days.  Will the hedgehogs hold out that long?  Absolutely not.   Who wants to stay in a hedge fund losing $300MM a day.  Calculate those ROIs. Now at to that the number of call positions out there and multiply those by 100 shares per contract.  By Friday, Feb 5th, there appear to be 28,064 calls for 2,806,400 shares and if the price is maintained at $325 will cost the hedgehogs $912M post $1.5B in interest for a total of close to $2.5B.  see why they needed to borrow $2.75B from their fellow hedgehog?  That is by next Friday. BUT, will the price of the stock stay at $325 for the buyback? If the price goes up to $500 per share as it did before they restricted trading, that will cost them $1.4B for the stock and $2.5B in interest or $3.9B for the week.  Every week the cost magnifies and they must either borrow funds or seek shares in profitable investments to cover the short.  How long can they lose and others stand my them versus just covering their losses?  If they can share you away and drop the price to cover, they can save their asses.  If you hold, they will have to cover.  If you don't sell, they can't buy cheap and if they can't buy cheap, they won't be able to borrow to cover.

[We know](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/) gamestop's historic average volume is 6M shares/day in 2020 

[We know](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/) gamestop's average volume over the last 2 weeks has been 100M shares/day

We know gamestop's short interest as of 12/31/2020 was [68M](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) and the float is 47M, a short of 145% available float.

If gamestop traded an average of 6M shares a day and the float is 47M, 12.7% of the available shares exchanged hands every day. You would need 11 days to establish or cover a short of 145% of float.

But in 2021, an average of 100M shares are traded a day on a float of 47M. 212% of the available shares exchange hands every day. If the short interest as of 1/15/2020 is [62M](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/), the entire position could be established and covered on the same day.

The people shorting now have a completely different risk tolerance and they are establishing and covering shorts in a liquid market. Whereas Melvin and Citron can't hold when their $20 shorts go to $100, that would be a $300 short today going to $1500. There is no more squeeze purchasing taking place. 

Let's show what it would take to squeeze the new shorts and go to the moon. To reach $1500, Gamestop would be a market capitalization of 105B, making it nearly one of the largest 100 companies in the world. To get there from 21B, around 80B in capital will need to come from institutions or individuals. This would take every one of the 31M brokerage accounts in the U.S. investing $2,580 in Gamestop.

There are so many moving parts, people who owe people who owe people, it takes time for trades to settle, everyone's exposed to different kinds of risk. Maybe the hedges liquidate or get bailed out and cover at moon prices. Maybe they pull more slimy moves to get brokers to force more monkeys to sell cheaply and restrict buys. Maybe trading gets officially suspended. Maybe the plumbing gets clogged and no one can buy or sell because the intermediaries (brokers, clearing houses) are fucked up. Maybe the hedges pull a [piggly wiggly](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1959/06/06/a-corner-in-piggly-wiggly) and just slip out of their short obligations.

1. There's no unified exit strategy, and we don't have a way to actually know everyone's personal risk tolerance. It's fun to say ""I like the stock"" and that you're ""never selling"", but there's no way that this stock holds at $1,000 and has enough buyers to take shares from casual investors for long enough that everyone gets that price. Another thing: this lack of exit strategy is another major contributing factor to the lack of the squeeze! Limit sells have set up huge walls at $420.69, $1,000, etc that need to be bought up before the rocket goes off, because there is no coordinated out position!


2. Once the sell happens, the resistance isn't strong enough on the way down for the stock to last at *any* premium. People will know the ride is over. People won't watch their portfolio go from +20,000% to +10,000% and have diamond hands. This is life changing money for a lot of people, and it boils down to risk tolerance, as I said above. Would people really give up a chance at hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars for the memes? To fuck the system? Once that reality sets in, the rush to scrounge what is left will crater the price. Supply will exceed demand in a historic way and it will be $30. Speaking of hedgies....


3. If you don't think there's value in playing the ride down, you'd be delusional. Hedge funds and normal joe's know this: the put market is at an insane premium, and there's heavy short action at the new ""top"". Hedge funds are feeling this right now but they're also not stupid - they're making some of the same plays we are, and they have much higher risk tolerance than the average investor. They will recoup a historic amount of capital on the way down.


4. Suppose a significant contingent of people do diamond hands this thing, and we stabilize at a premium ($30-50). GME is a business - they'll issue stock and capture the premium to backfill their balance sheets. They're already talking about this, it's in the news.


5. Suppose we do enter a gamma squeeze and we approach $1500. Does anyone think the robinhood investor has enough capital to enter at that price and push it higher? Robinhood isn't even selling more than 2 shares, let alone fractional shares. The dynamics will change because the people controlling the squeeze will be the same ones controlling the most capital: the funds. The squeeze will stop like VW 2008 and they'll be confident in getting in short for the ride down.


6. The squeeze might never happen because the brokers are clearly controlling the buy side with trading restrictions. Does it look like the SEC is rushing in to stop them?? The longer these restrictions hold the greater the enthusiasm gap. Once the next fad comes along people will get bored.

For a lot of us, it wasn’t just a value play. It was a value play on a company that we grew up with and loved. I’ve had my PS5 money sitting in my bank account since the beginning of November waiting for GME to get the PS5 back in stock because I give my business to them.

Also, have you looked at the balance sheet? IIRC they owe around 250m more this year (I’m sure Q4 earning will cover that) and another 500m~ by 2023. They earned 6bn in revenue q3 2019 to q3 2020.

This is quickly becoming a 4chan cult.

The float traded many times over this week. The hedge funds with low basis shorts got out. They lost money. There are new shorts at higher levels.  There always will be.  Maybe they can get squeezed again or a little more if the hype machine gets more buyers to come in, but the narrative that this is some sort of class warfare battle at this point is completely wrong. Retail accounted for more than half of sales this week. Folks who are holding their shares for a big squeeze will be left with the bag when the music stops, and it will absolutely suck to see. You may be reading this now thinking I'm some sort of corporate shill or whatever the fuck, but two weeks from now you'll (hopefully) look back and ask how you fell victim to this group think.
