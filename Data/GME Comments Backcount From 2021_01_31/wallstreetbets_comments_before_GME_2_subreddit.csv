You have to manually sell at whatever price you can manage to type in fast enough and execute on, or limit sell in that moment at 50% above.

I know some people argue that short selling is to motivate whistleblowing by incentivizing the company failure of fraudulent companies, but lawsuits can do the same thing.

I will face the dip.  
I will permit it to pass over me and through me, buying more shares as it falls.  
And when the dip has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path to the moon.   
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.  
 
Only WSB will remain.

As of the close Friday you could sell a March $700 call for about $12,000 against every 100 of your shares.. WHEN the share price gets close to $700 you can buy back the short call (for something like $17,000) and simultaneously sell something like a $800 call the next expiration cycle out for the same price u just bought the short $700 for and maintain your hedge.
Maybe hedge half of your long position this way and still maintain unlimited upside on half while having about $65-75 per share of downside protection over all WITH substantial upside on the hedged portion of your position.. Just saying, thats what the pros like Jon Najarian do. Bang.
NOTE: To insure you receive an additional credit when rolling your short calls out and up,  the short call should be rolled BEFORE IT IS IN THE MONEY.

No, not exactly. You are right that the short positions are not all closed, but this is the wrong reasoning. Shorts are borrowing stock with the goal of buying it back when it is cheaper and then pocketing the difference. With the exorbitant rise in price, also comes the need for a rise in capital in their accounts to avoid what can only be called the mother of all margin calls aka liquidation of their hedge funds.

1084,glh59ah,t1_glge9sb,"No. Price is set where the Ask and Bid meet. 

You alone don't control the price, the market is.

A buy limit only means ""I am willing to buy at that price"". It doesn't mean it will happen, your order could limbo there forever (or eventually set to expire by your trading platform).

You would put that lower buy limit for two reasons: 1. You want to get in at a price lower than current, because you think they'll continue to drive the price down to save their asses, and also hope the price will bounce back so you'll be in the safe spot later 2. To set a safety net so the price won't tank; if enough people set their limits to the same price (usually a round number, say 50 or whatever, because people think the same and are predictable) it creates a buy wall at that level.  IF the selling volume is lower than the buying volume, the price will bounce back from that level; OR in the inverse case, if the wall doesn't hold, push through lower and you end up in a losing position at least for the time being.

The same applies for a sell limit order. It is an order saying ""I want to sell at this price"". It's actually the technique used by HFs / short sellers this past week, hence the swings: they create a ""sell wall"" in order to supress the price, like it happened at 320 Friday just before market close. If their volume is high enough and the buying side is not as powerful, buying orders will eat some of the wall, they move the wall a little more down, and so on (done automatically by computer algorithms anyway) in the hopes that people not realising what's going on and also not being in for the long run (hence the term ""paper hands"") get scared and quickly sell thinking that the price can't get any higher so there won't be any profit for them. They sell quickly and at lower than they bought, possibly causing a chain reaction, and also lose from the fees of the transactions.

If you want in, ONLY trade with what you are willing to lose. For one, you bet against powerful actors, and two, new (usually clueless) traders tend to end up in a losing position (this, I do know from experience; just read older WSB posts; there are more losers in the stock market than winners; there's a reason Wall Street call individual, aka unorganized aka retail traders the ""stupid money""; this is what WSB is currently trying to flip over for once).

I have very little experience with this, don't trust what I say, I might be completely wrong, and learn on your own before doing anything, at least the basics. WSB is a memeing sub, head over to /r/investing if you want serious discussions and learn. I'm not a financial advisor, what I THINK I know is from Wikipedia, Youtube and Investopedia.

SUPPLY: You (and many others on WSB) have the supply. If you HOLD, you retain the supply. If you BUY THE DIP for more shares, you have MORE SUPPLY and can then HOLD more supply.


DEMAND: The hedgies who have shorted GME have a STRONG DEMAND for GME shares. In fact, they might even have a legally obligated DEMAND for your shares.


Tldr:  HOLD, BUY THE DIP (if you can, for more shares). GME price will go up AUTOMATICALLY.

It has APPEARED that way during trading halts and that weird spread shows on EVERY SINGLE STOK HALT ALWAYS. That information proves NOTHING related to liquidity. I won’t even get into the other factors making that impossible, one of which is that there are ZERO sales above like $515. So if the spread was miraculously $1000, where is the +$1000 transaction? And no, you can’t cite the random fractional shares people on RH for $2500 for. That’s the hard truth of buying and selling fractionals for an in demand equity. 

Second, you all need to start realizing the shorts are very likely cycling up in price. Yeah, they booked losses, big ones. But that is already booked. Now they can short at $300+ and obtain that $300+ NOW. Sure, they’ll pay interest on the short and yes that hurts. But they are also buying calls and selling puts to offset immediate losses and just biding their fuckin time. 

Second, brokerages limiting shares has fuck all nothing to do with liquidity and everything to do with 1- being shitty brokers and 2- not having capital to back up transactions until they settle. Do you really think liquidity is an issue with 50M shares changing hands each day? Fuck no. 

Give me all the god damn down votes you want but this stupid ass single sided “DD” is a fuckin joke and unless we all start to THINK and consider reality instead of regurgitating tired ass talking points, everyone who got in above $300 is gonna get fucking smoked.

Edit: and setting sell limits at $1000 or $100000000000000000 just means brokers know some dumb mother fucker has played his hand. And they will simply stop buying shares at some point. And retails already can’t afford them at volume so who the hell do you think is gonna buy that $5000 share? While they wait, pay their interest, cycle up in price. Wait again. And in the end, people will sell because millions of small guys, myself included, know better than to look a gift horse in the mouth on a god damn 500% roi.

 Remember the ""3 trillion dollars"" the fed printed last April during the oil short squeeze? I didn't think so. That was entirely the repo market printing money to cover the liquidity crisis that ensued.  A normal day 1 trillion dollars of repo is issued.  No way we broke the repo market with just gme trading on robinhood.

1540,glheosk,t3_l94hdi,"IMPORTANT question to the experts in here📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📣📣📣📣📣📣

In the below links there are 2 charts, 1 for GME and 1 for AMC

According to it

GME Has 65.20 millions outstanding shares

GME has 50.65 millions float shares

GME has 121.98 % shorts float


AMC has 107.70 million outstanding shares 

AMC has 101.95 million float shares

AMC has 43.82 % shorts float


🧐🧐🤔🤔🤔

It does NOT makes sense to me.

The difference between outstanding shares and float shares of both GME and AMC is almost exactly the same

BUT BUT BUT the percentage of short float is almost triple????

Can someone please explain this.

Very important For ALL of us here

Here's the thing, though.  If you only put in $60 that's all you'll be able to use unless you put in more with another account or by a different means.  For example, if you linked your bank account you won't be able to add more ach funds from that bank account until it's verified.

I called my bank about this because usually funds come out right away and I'm notified, even for small amounts and especially for larger amounts. It makes no sense to me why funds hit tda before it cleared my bank.

No, I haven't wire transferred.  But I did ask my bank about this too when I called which was after official banking hours.  My bank charges a fee for wire transfers ($10) but said wired funds would hit my tda account in time for me to trade the next morning.  She told me wire transfers clear between midnight and 7am the next day (or something close to that.) I ended up not wiring because I finally got my account verified and didn't have to do a wire transfer, saved the $10 wire fee.

Your order will be executed at the market opening price on the next business day (M - F) excluding holidays. For example, when the market closed with an AMC price of $13.26 per on Friday, there was nominal after-hours trading pushing it up to about $13.45. If the market opens at $13.45, your buy would execute at $13.45 per. With a set dollar amount, you would get whatever full and partial shares your money could buy since the purchase of partial shares of AMC is permitted. I say it that way because for future reference,  not all brokerages allow the purchase of partial shares.

If Robinhood “goes away” it’s because they are handing over their portfolios to a broker with the capital and liquidity to not have to put out a fire three times a day.

If RH “goes away” it may not be rebranded. It may still actually be RH, it just will be *entirely* owned by institutional investors rather than partially.

Edit: I don’t think these scenarios are outside the realm of what’s possible. 

RH’s excuse about liquidity obligations doesn’t hold water when held up to the light of their “solution” for it: to *restrict* buying very particular stocks (GME) and encourage selling those same stocks.

I’m not saying there wasn’t a liquidity issue. I’m not even saying this didn’t fix it - if there was. But I am saying with 100% certainty that there was a solution that didn’t involve taking the side of hedge funds over the demographic you purportedly developed this app to empower.

The largest financial institutions in the world have to solve liquidity-obligation problems on a daily basis. This wasn’t an unprecedented situation they were in, even if how they got there was in fact unprecedented.

>Freeze your platform **entirely** and get on the phone with the fucking Fed... five minutes ago. 

I don’t know who they called for advice but whoever it was was a dumbass because they said anything *except* that.

So long story, longer... I think RH shaking up ownership is inevitable, if not imminent, and may be the first defensive posture taken in the hopes to avoid prosecutors/regulators catching whiff of the horrible decisions made that fateful day.",5,wallstreetbets,1612067530.0,1612067031.0
