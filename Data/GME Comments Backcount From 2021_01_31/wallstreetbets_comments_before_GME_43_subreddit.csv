5,glefbcb,t3_l8tkws,"CONCERNING RH, FIDELITY, VANGUARD, and $GME

Let's get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required. So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are... 🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. (I have also heard TDA is ok) You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail. This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

Basically, about 30% of GME shares are owned by just 3 investment firms (Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard). Another 30% is own by other investment firms and Ryan Cohen, which brings it to over 60%... all of who have a vested interest in seeing GME moon.

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON. Take this opportunity by the balls and never let go. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 USE YOUR 💎🙌

SOURCE: [https://fintel.io/so/us/gme.](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)

Check the institutional ownership of GME, If you think for one second that Blackrock, the world's largest investment fund, is going to let GME fail then you must be literally retarded.

They do not lose money. Period.

86,glerw06,t1_glednui,"I attempted to move my holdings to Fidelity today. I was on hold for over an hour. You can submit the transfer online if you already have a fidelity account.

## Important! This is the time to read:

1. **Retards on Margin:** If you are using margin on Robinhood, apply for margin on Fidelity. Currently it takes about 3 days for approval (Fidelity is very busy right now, as I assume are other brokerages).
2. **Retards on Options:** If you have options that you want transferred to Fidelity, turn on options trading. Again this takes about 3 days for approval.
3. **Retards on Robinhood:** If you are transferring from Robinhood to Fidelity (or any other brokerage I assume): The Fidelity rep asked me to send my documents from Robinhood. Currently I am unable to get these documents and Robinhood keeps giving me an error (in the app *-> Profile -> Statements & Taxes -> Account Documents*). My guess on why this is happening is because the mass exodus of users from Robinhood to other brokerages. The Fidelity rep said sorry for the wait and told me his last 10 calls were from Robinhood users trying to transfer into Fidelity.
4. If anyone knows how to get the documents from Robinhood please reply here or DM me. I am unable to move my assets out.

**Transfer Time: This is also very important.**

If you are moving out of Robinhood to Fidelity, I was told it can take up to 5 business days. I repeat - BUSINESS DAYS. They are currently very busy due to the current marketing conditions, the influx of new users, and tax season. You can do a partial transfer of your assets. First transfer is free (they cover the $75 cost). Might be wise to keep your $GME and other volatile names in Robinhood or they can get stuck in purgatory until the 5 day transfer is over. That being said... we dont sell anyways.

Michael Burry said in order to execute the short squeeze we have to make the shorts scramble for shares. **This means using a Legitimate Broker that WONT lend your shares to short sellers.** The more GME shares are locked in Fidelity or Vanguard, the more the price of GME rockets because shorts need to get these shares somewhere else. 

* **Get the f off Robin-hood**

* ⁠Get your GME shares off Robinhood NOW

* Unite under **FIDELITY** or **VANGUARD**

* These brokers **DONT lend your shares** to anyone (suits)

* Use a legitimate broker that *doesnt LEND your shares* to short suits. 

* Meaning = GME Price 🚀 🚀 🚀

Editting since this post has visibility:
**DONT SELL ON RH THINKING YOU CAN REBUY WITH NEW MONeY ON OTHER PLACES. It wont work out b/c of the timing of the orders. They play a fuck load of games with timing it. Basically RH sells your order info to Citadel .5 seconds before it executes. This makes it so they can do some crazy super computer magic and make trades favorable to them in that .5 seconds and have it execute before yours. If this happens, they will just trade the stocks back and forth and tank the price. Its fucked up**

Just set a really high limit order for your sell at 9999 or 5555. They can't lend out your shares if you set a limit order. IF YOU TRANSFER, YOUR SHARE OWNERSHIP WILL BE IN LIMBO AND YOU WONT BE ABLE TO SELL ON TIME. DONT LISTEN TO THIS FUCKIGN IDIOT.

Buy new shit on other places but DONT TRANSFER YOUR EXISTING SHARES OFF OF RH. YOU WILL FUCK YOURSELF UP.

RH IS ASSHOLES THEY WILL TAKE AS LONG AS THEY CAN FOR THE TRANSFER MAYBE EVEN NEXT MONTH.

Editting since this post has visibility:
**DONT SELL ON RH THINKING YOU CAN REBUY WITH NEW MONeY ON OTHER PLACES. It wont work out b/c of the timing of the orders. They play a fuck load of games with timing it. Basically RH sells your order info to Citadel .5 seconds before it executes. This makes it so they can do some crazy super computer magic and make trades favorable to them in that .5 seconds and have it execute before yours. If this happens, they will just trade the stocks back and forth and tank the price. Its fucked up**

The only TRUE value something has is what someone else is willing to pay you for it.

For example: I have one fraction of a share in GameStonk. They're basically you yanks' EBGames. EBGames has given me a lot if very fond memories and was a huge part of my childhood.

I reckon my 1/10 of a single share in GaemStonk simply MUST be worth at least a hundred, based on that value alone.

John Clifton ""Jack"" Bogle (May 8, 1929 – January 16, 2019) was an American investor, business magnate, and philanthropist. He was the founder and chief executive of The Vanguard Group, and is credited with creating the first index fund. An avid investor and money manager himself, he preached investment over speculation, long-term patience over short-term action, and reducing broker fees as much as possible. The ideal investment vehicle for Bogle was a low-cost index fund held over a period of a lifetime with dividends reinvested and purchased with dollar cost averaging.

611,gleczgc,t3_l8tf06,"Isn't it possible that they just opened up longs to hedge? (Or just buy the equivalent amount of shares, meaning they are slowly just accumulating?) If you have a short at $40 and you long at $90 then your losses are capped at $50 per share? Fees and interest not included. No matter how high the price goes they would always be capped at $50 losses. 

It's stupid but it's like opening a long and short at the same price - you can't earn and it's a zero sum game.

If they suddenly dump the price from $500, and close all their longs (or sell all their shares) they could profit significantly if their average sell price is $400 and they gained on everything from $90 to $400. 

So now not only did they make multiples on what they lost with the short, by profiting from the long, but if they induce enough panic selling and paper hands fold they could eventually bring their shorts closer to a zero sum game.

I don't know enough about options to understand if my idea is even legitimate in any way, but what if they are just going long with us? Egging us on,

So perhaps that injection of capital didn't go to cover margin requirements but to open up longs when we were below $150s? That huge spike from $150 to $350...that doesn't feel like a million coordinated buyers. That was just a giant swallow of the supply.

You're way better off locking in your losses with a counter directional position as a hedge, than acting like a sitting duck adding more capital to your account to lose. 

So is the reason we're stagnating at these $350 prices because they keep buying up the price to $400 or $450, more retail money follows as we spread the word, and they are dumping on us a little at a time. Small gains. And potentially closing out the shorts a little at a time?

Based on my novice understanding of hedging, as institutional money I'd have locked in my losses as soon as I got that injection of capital on the 25th. Go long. Then egg on the opposition and cry like I'm a sore loser. Entice everyone to stick it to me. My longs double, triple, quadruple. Every dip at the top is me taking profits at the top, scooping up the lows. With so much volume no one would ever know. 

Is this a possible strategy for them?

The stock market IMO doesn't operate as intended when it was created. Because of shorts purposely and actively tanking a share price. I guarantee this wasn't thought of as an option at all.

707,gleexmh,t3_l8te7d,"Not sure it's quite that simple.

Disclaimer: I'm smooth brained and know nothing.

Far more likely: RH didn't have the capital to cover the collateral obligations on the volume of GME trading, and had to throttle that volume, first by halting trading, then by limiting buys to keep from completely running out of cash.


If WSB has grown by 4mm users in two weeks, and many of those users started using RH to trade GME, I'm fairly certain RH's operational model wasn't designed for 1) that influx of new users joining at the same time or 2) that volume of transactions on a single equity. 

Now, could they have solved the problem faster - raise more capital to keep the transactions flowing? Yes, and that's where I think the manipulation comes in. If they had wanted the retail investors to win, they could have raised/borrowed the capital to cover their requirements and unleashed the floodgates. 

But they didn't. Either because their HF backers didn't want that outcome, or because RH wanted to give the HF's a chance to regroup.

Either way, it's another great lesson in the truth tat nothing free is actually free - especially in financial markets - and the real costs can manifest at the worst possible moments.

**GME Phase 4: After the Endgame**

For those of you YOLOing this shit, those of you worried about exit strategies, those of you unsure whether or not it's too late to buy in, those of you swept up in the moment--

# This is a friendly reminder of some basic facts:

A lot of people are talking about 💎🙌🏻-ing this shit till everything blows up like this is a ticking time bomb counting down towards some inevitable apocalyptic \*event\* wherein this massive war of attrition leaves soldiers dead in the field and glory for everyone on the right side of history. I love this narrative, but folks, let's settle down.

At the end of the day, GameStop is still a company. There is still value to be had. There is a reason why DFV chose to invest in it in the first place, a reason why Michael Burry bought almost 2 million shares, a reason why Ryan Cohen took a 13% stake in this company... and that is that this stock was fundamentally a turnaround long term play. People--myself included--love to talk in hyperbole about how we're in it till the bitter end, how we're ready to hold empty bags until everyone else has gotten off the rocket, blah blah blah... but remember: **this stock is not going to zero after the squeeze**. Yes if you buy in at $1000 or $2000 you might end up in trouble, but the idea of a short squeeze is to make the shorts buy at those prices. The original thesis from 3 months ago, from 6 months ago, from September 2019 is still there, and after the millions and millions of dollars worth of free publicity from this whole saga, the thesis is arguably stronger than ever. GME now has popular/populist support behind it as a company, massive exposure, a super compelling underdog story that has been sold to the world for fucking free. You know there's a Hollywood movie coming. If before all this, even Andrew MotherFucking Left thought GME was worth $20/share, tell me where do you think all this added value leaves us? Before the squeeze, I've seen people argue convincingly that GME might be worth $40, $60, $120, even $400 a share (ok I didn't totally buy the $400 thesis but I'm a retard what do I know), so where do you think all this publicity and a zeroed out debt sheet for GME leaves the company?

I say all this because this is part of why I know I'm gonna fucking 💎🙌🏻 this for the long haul. Partly cuz I'm not gonna say no to being a noble goddamn hero white knight to the common people in my own fucking egotistical construction of my self-identity (and nobody else is gonna give a fuck), but partly because I still do really believe in GME as a fundamentally sound stock to own, especially after this whole story is said and done. There's a chunk of what I bought at $300+ a share that I fully plan on selling for long term cap gains someday as I feebly enter the order through a mindlink from an autonomous robotaxi chauffeuring me to see my great granddaughter cyborg at the neighboring Mars colony. If you bought in at a point where, looking back, the dollar cost avg is still reasonable to you (whatever that is, go ask a real autist), and find yourself doubting or scared and you need a reason to believe, just remember this:

# GME is a company, not just a slogan

Also, as a final note. For all you noobs who are cashing out for 6 figures or more on this play, I'm honestly really fucking happy for you, but please remember: **you're gonna have to pay capital gains come next year**. Don't go spending it all, don't go donating it all, cuz if you forget this simple fact of life (as I have in the past) you will be fuuuuuucked when the IRS comes calling next year. Make sure you set aside some 40% of your gains to put in something super conservative like a wheel options on broad market ETFs or something so you can be ready for the tax bill next year, which is a long fucking ways away from now and very easy to forget about.

Now that I have your attention, I've been a redditor for almost 10 years, rarely submitting posts or commenting, just mainly a lurker to read comments.

I stumbled upon some due diligence posts about GME over the past weekend, and decided to jump in on Monday at a price at $95. I still haven't sold, but with a stock price at $325, I could have easily tripled my money throughout the week and got out.

I mainly have followed the conservative investing subreddits, such as [r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/), [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/), [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/), which have suggested to invest in total stock market index funds, reduce fees, and enjoy my 7% return after inflation. After 6 years of this, things have been going ok, good, but not nutbusting exciting. I returned almost just as much from GME in this past week than from my entire 6 week working career. Granted, I know my GME earnings are fictitious, since I haven't sold yet and it can come crashing down (being a bagholder) at any point.

This whole week, I thought to myself, what sell target should I set? Since I consider myself a fairly conservative person, I would have been happy with doubling, or tripling my money and to not take part in this fiasco. After learning about infinity squeezes, I set my price target at $999.

After this past week transpired, I think here are some events that transpired that I think were the nails in the coffin for the hedge funds in wall street.

1. Viral spread of social media. EVERYONE is talking about GME. Everyone is going into WallStreetBets and taking a look. My boomer dad mentioned it to me last week, even before I heard about what was going on! Hedge funds have underestimated the power of virility of information through the internet and its exponential speed of growth. EVERYONE is buying stocks, all over the globe, from an already short supply of available stocks in the float.

2. Tweets from billionaires. Chamath Palihapitiya and Elon Musk, some of the most famous billionaries in the world!!!! Tweeted about GME. This is something that Wall street could have NEVER forecasted. This was the nail in the coffin for them, they never saw this type of exposure coming. Millions of people follow these billionaires, they are jumping in on the fun, and we have influential billionaires on our side.

3. Other hedge fund sharks coming in. Now that there is blood in the water, other hedge funds are joining in the party. They know what short squeezes are, they know how to put other funds in vulnerable positions and to play the odds. Not only do we have the power of [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and the people of the ENTIRE world, but we also have the power of other whales. The enemy of our enemies are really going to be the ones to push us past the finish line.

I thought to myself, Melvin capital and these hedge funds guys, they're smart. They'll figure out a way to weasel out of this situation and STILL make money some how. But with the 3 big factors above, these are things that they could have never seen coming, which makes me think they are utterly f\*cked.

Now for exit strategy price target. I currently have a $1,000 price target to would trigger, allowing me to break even, and then another sell limit order at $1,500, that would 15x my money. Bear in mind, I consider myself a conservative average joe, and want to get in and out QUICKLY. So here is another data point for you guys, for what a fairly conservative person is setting his price target at.

I know everyone here has crazy meme price targets of $69,420 etc., but this would just crash the entire economy. So I thought to myself, what would the max price target be without initiating government intervention? If the government gets involved, this could ruin the party for everybody. Can someone help me do the calculation, with a price target that would bankrupt only the hedge funds and market makers involved, and not the underlying banks that would initiate government intervation?

Thank you! Also, this is not investment advice.

Targa or Tentacle or something like that. Maybe it has an s in it too. Anyway, 15 years later that guy and that company are the richest person and the biggest car company.

Surely they're not going to hold? So if 75% of the stock sells at some point, and Melvin buys those shares, can't they trade them back and forward to cover the full outstanding short, even if every single one of us apes holds firm and doesn't sell a single share?

&#x200B;

Aren't we creating a situation in which we pay for the big firms who hold 75% to make a killing?

&#x200B;

Also what were to happen if the shorts declare bankruptcy? Would the pressure of the short squeeze be completely halted, and stock price would return to it's $20? Would we be able to sell the shares at it's current market price, but there would be no upward pressure on the price?

I have damn near every dollar I've saved in GME, and I don't plan on leaving until a long way down the road. I just want to know how much of risk I actually have, and who's hands my fate lies in.

898,gled0wv,t1_glecl48,"I recently purchased 12 $GME @ 160 because i am dumb and don't understand how stonks work (i think they go up) but i like video games and I like the stock.

I don't know if any degenerates here actually play video games or you're instead busy just rubbing your monster balls with your diamond hands all day...

BUT GameStop offers pre-orders of games.

you give $GME money now, to reserve a copy of a game for later.

payment processes a week before pre order release.

so $GME holds on to your money for now and you get the game when its released. 


but you can cancel your pre-order at any time if you decide you no longer want the game (or up to 30 days after release date). lucky for us, games are cheaper than shares of $GME.

here is a list of games you can pre-order:

https://www.gamestop.com/video-games?prefn1=availabilityFilter&prefv1=preOrder

hopefully if you like any games, you'll pre order. just like buying stocks you like.",1,wallstreetbets,1612035107.0,1612034637.0
