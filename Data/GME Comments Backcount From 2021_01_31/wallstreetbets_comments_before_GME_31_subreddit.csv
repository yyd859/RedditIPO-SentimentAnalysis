Don't let people parachute in and co-opt our movement.

They're either hedge fund plants, fedposting or washed-up boomers and junior mining players who have been irrelevant and underwater for years.

The goal is to crush the shorts and get rich.

Anything other then that, we run the risk of financial ruin.

We're not here in a crusade to beat the bullion banks or crush the COMEX.

That's fighting the boomers' war.

Like most things over the past 60 years, they were to selfish and self-absorbed to do anything about it. 

Epic generational fail.

Don't let these ossified has-beens distract you.

If they were of any use, they would have solved their own problems. Now they want to drag us into their bullshit deals to save them. 

Fuck that, the Turks are in charge now.

We will show them how it's done.

All in on $GME or nothing!

After we win that one, we can circle back and consider bailing them out.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1. most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @ 250+
2. covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3. if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4. this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5. conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion: Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher. All paperhands, you are safe to hold, even if it dips all the way down to 1$, three times.

The quick and dirty of it is that the Silver trade is a possibility, but there is less of a chance that market gets squeezed as its a bigger market and has more implications for the financial sector. The GME trade has a much greater chance of succeeding IMO, and so that is where my focus is right now. The silver trade can wait.

That's obviously an oversimplification, but the thing is, VW technically wasn't over 100% at first either... it's just that Porsche had quietly snapped up too many (most) of the open shares before anyone noticed (and once they announced it, it was already too late, Ozymandias style).

A sub-100% shorted stock could, IN THEORY, be made to squeeze, if available shares could be pulled out of the float quickly enough. But you'd certainly never manage that by announcing publicly you wanted to and trying to get others on board.

People want things to be easy, and they want to make complicated things simple so that they feel they have a grasp of the situation. It's human nature. But reality is messy, and complex. GME really was a perfect storm. And, frankly, DFV going public about it and building a ground swell of support for it was part of the equation... he never could have orchestrated the short alone, the price never would have gone high enough to be more than a blip despite the right conditions in their greedy positions.

778,glffhdy,t1_glf98ym,"Yeah, Poker is a better analogy. Any pro will tell you, that it can be hell to play against a clueless person, because they'll make completely brain dead moves, but due to that unpredictability it sometimes works anyway, because it totally messes up any high-level strategy the pro was using.

This goes for a lot of other things, too. Like 1st person shooters: experienced, high-level players will always try to aim for the head, so ducking can be a good close to medium quarter tactic. If you then run into a noob who always aims at center mass, ducking will only move your head right into their crosshair.

So to bring it back to the stock market: the hedge fund managers were used to the market reacting predictably when selling short. They were doing the old song and dance, even *announcing* that they're about to do it (how's *that* legal?), probably hoping that all the other HF jump on board to maximize the dip.

PLS READ AND SHARE SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE NEXT PHASE:

To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:

AMC current status (30JAN2021) :
AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold, the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.

Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher. 

Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46%",2,wallstreetbets,1612043475.0,1612043013.0

928,glev4a4,t3_l8whcp,"If you’re in for long, move your shares the fuck out of Robinhood.

If you don’t have a price target in mind at which you want to flop, but plan to keep your shares with the 💎🙌 until the death separates you, you need to transfer the shares from Robinhood to an actual no-shithole broker (Fidelity, Vanguard, TDA, Schwab, IB) that will allow you to either forbid the shorts from using them, or pocket the borrowing fee.

Now this explanation is gonna be a bit technical, but the last time a revolution of illiterates on the American soil succeeded was in 1783 (i.e. back in boomer time if you’re not good with numbers too), so you need to be able to read and convert to PDF at the very least.

When you buy shares at Robinhood or any other zero-fee broker, they can lend the shares to hedge funds for shorting. For that, they get a borrowing fee which can be pretty substantial (around 30% of share price per year in case of GME this week I heard). This is one way for them to earn money that they don’t get from the transaction fees. So even if you buy and hold as the most retarded 🦍 in the wild, hedge funds and Robinhood still screw you from behind.

To prevent this from happening, open an account at a proper large broker and request Robinhood to transfer the shares there. Be aware that it will take several business days, and during these periods the shares will be frozen and unavailable for selling. Shouldn’t matter much though, because your 💎🙌 are for real.

After that, ask the broker if the shares are held in your name or street name. In the latter case, ask to move them to your name. This will allow you to claim the borrowing fee. It might be a good idea to check this with your broker first.

If you want to outright forbid the hedge scum bags to short your shares at all (like Michael J. “This guy fucks (the investment banks)” Burry did), ask your broker to do that too. You won’t get your borrowing fee, and hedge funds won’t get the shares for shorting. And boy are they gonna get hurt.

2 years ago, a buddy asked me to check out this sub because of all the tendies you retards have been making. All of y’all are so incredible that I fell in love with the sub immediately. As a long time lurker, I feel that it’s time to share what I know to help everyone. 

So, I’ve heard and seen some crazy news about what could potentially happen to Robinhood this weekend. But I don’t want to add to the FUD so I’ll pretend it wasn’t there. 

But, I’ve seen many people here with their hands tied with the new Robinhood trading restrictions when it come to buying stock they happen to REALLY like. If you want to move your accounts away from Robinhood here’s what you can do:

1. Open an account with the new brokerage: Fidelity, TD, Vanguard, whoever that allows you to buy what you want

2. Process a partial account transfer aka Partial ACAT

3. Continue to use the new brokerage account to buy and 💎🙌💎

4. ACAT settlement period is typically 5 business days for full account transfer but partial ACAT is usually 3 business days. 


TL;DR: open a new brokerage, then process partial ACAT. Since all of us will be holding anyway, it won’t matter that it’s in transit, and you have 2 new places to buy stonks.

And unless there is some systemic problems with RH's systems (unlikely) someone will lend them capital to pad the buffer until the VAR on GME drops down from infinity..  

It takes a few days for trades to clear (T+2), after which the buffer tied up in those trades is released.  The peak of this problem (everyone on their platform buying the highest risk name at the same time) for RH is passed, and by Wednesday it's very likely the restrictions will be loosened.

My personal recommendation is to take funds out sitting in Robinhood that haven't been used to buy shares immediately and make a new account on another brokerage as you said.

As for shares, that is your own call, and your own decision. As someone else mentioned, transferring can take a few days.

AMC second most shorted behind GME at 79%. Shorts actually jumped 10% between Thursday and Friday to try and cover losses in GME.

AMC closed above $9 on Fri meaning come Monday, hedges have to start paying off the shorts or risk interest. A few other deadlines between Mon- Thurs that force this as well. Thus the price will be driven up.

997,glez7sc,t1_gletr7r,"Not really. The fact that GameStop has more shares shorted then are available is why the demand for such shares are so high. If folks simply hold shares (marked unavailable for trade), the supply of panicked short sellers increases because there are less shares available to buy to close their positions.  In this scenario, short sellers need to buy 150 shares of the 100 that are available.  If someone chooses not to sell,  suddenly they need to buy 150 shares of 90 shares available.  This creates panic because what if you’re not one of the lucky short sellers able to buy a shares to close your position?  You have to wait/offer to pay more for the shares.  Being beyond 100% short is the magic that makes this truly possible.  Amc, though incredibly shorted, has the ability for funds to buy everything back because they aren’t short beyond available shares.  Other highly shorted positions still force squeezes, but not nearly to the same leveraging degree.  AMC et al is meant to detract from the reality that is GME.

I personally don't care. I didn't invest that much. Here's what I told others:

The options are:

Hold on robinhood - or in other words continue waiting for them fuck us even harder than they already have. I wouldn't be surprised if they won't let people cash out when it's time.

Sell - do I even have to say why this isn't a good option?

Transfer - maybe I miss the squeeze. But this is no longer about the money. This is about sending a message. I barely have $500 invested so my ""loss"" is pretty minimal.

Haven't you heard though? The upside...

Well the upside is infinity if I'm right.

This is not financial advice.

Obviously everyone has their own risk tolerances. If I miss then I'm only out $500 bucks. But If I'm right, well the rewards are insane.

They give instant deposit to new members no problem but wont reinstate when I have an actual history? Nah that seemed sketchy.

Let’s say you bought 2 shares at $50, spent $100.

You sell 2 at $325 and make 750, but have to pay taxes of 40% ($300). So technically you only have $450 and real profit is $350 if you never buy in again.

But you do buy in, because (“ive got $750”) you sold in RH and using that money in another broker.

So your cost went from $50 per share to $325, technically you have same number of shares, but you’ve already on the hook for that tax.

they probably know that many are asking themselves if they should sell at 1k or not what the hedge funds might do it probably let the price go up to 1k and make another ladder attack to make it seem like the squeeze has happened, therefore making other people sell their positions.

What did you get I said 55. He said what the fuck?! So I looked and noticed I got GM for 40k. I said fuck sold it and since it was already unsetttled funds I used I got a good faith violation meaning I scrambled and only got 7k into GME at 95.
