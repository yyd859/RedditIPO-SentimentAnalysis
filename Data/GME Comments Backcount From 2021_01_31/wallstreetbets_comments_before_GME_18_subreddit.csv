178,glfdwd1,t3_l902cb,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

If you sell any shares, that’s a taxable event. Set aside funds for taxes, unless you sold those shares at a loss. Consult a tax professional, you may owe quarterly taxes, and could be fined if you wait til your April 2022 return to pay.

If you transfer securities from one brokerage to another, this is not a taxable event.

1. People being paper-handed and selling at 1k.  

2. Institutions with larger amounts of shares selling their portions at lower prices in order to ensure closing their positions.

3. Unexpected sneakery from the hedge funds

4. People being unaware of how long the buying will last, so putting in limit orders lower than the current price (whatever that may be) to ensure their shares are the ones getting sold.

5. Idiots with meme prices.

438,glhg6tk,t3_l901lr,"We all know that $GME can literally hit any price upwards of $100K (or even more) a share. 

The question is, how much loss can the hedge funds, clearinghouses, and brokerages suffer before the government swoops in and arranges a negotiated price to settle their debt?

The same happened during the panic of 1901 with the Northern Pacific short squeeze. If these billionaire funds simply cry to daddy that they will go bankrupt and it'll crash the market, the federal government will almost certainly set a price for them to close out their contracts. They will have a loss, but not a market crashing and fund dissolving one.

The information we need to solve is this:

1. Total monetary value of all hedge fund assets (stock/bonds/cash) that have short interest in $GME

2. Total retail shares available to be sold (not restricted or limited) as it pertains to the overall float

3. Total outstanding short interest (not currently settled)

Total amount of cash/assets owned by the hedge funds with short interest in $GME, divided by the float, should give us a realistic number. 

IE: 46.89 million shares floated and 61.78 million shares shorted indicates the infinite squeeze is real. However, if we take 46.89 million shares, divided by the maximum amount the hedge funds CAN/WILL pay without federal intervention or bankruptcy is the biggest question.

Assuming that  Melvin is worth a total of 12.5 billion and Citadel is worth 34 billion, that's a total of 46.5 billion in TOTAL worth. That means absolutely zeroed out with complete bankruptcy after settling. If we divide 46.5 billion by 46.89 million shares works out to $1,000 a share for literally every outstanding share they have to pay. This does NOT include interest they owe.

Now, obviously this is only considering Melvin and Citadel. Any idea how many more hedge funds are involved and how much the total assets are? We all know the federal government will either bail them out or set a ""fair price"" to settle their debts. The stock can easily hit 10,000 or more per share, but citadel and Melvin alone won't be able to pay it. So our target price largely hinges on how many available resources exist in those that shorted the stock.

Total resources divided by outstanding shorted shares is the ""magic number"". It can always go higher but then some people will be left holding the bag after it's settled out. 

Can any of you that are good with deep research find out a list of the major companies with short interest in $GME?? This is the key for now.

Edit: if we take 1 trillion in total losses into consideration across all hedge funds, that will give us $21,739 a share approximately. That's also assuming that nobody paper hands it early. The number could increase if they do as long as outstanding shares exceed the float.",2,wallstreetbets,1612105315.0,1612053128.0

""Pretty Easily"" isn't true.

A) Shareholders have to vote on diluting shares. Insiders only hold 27% of shares. They would need whales and even us to vote yes on diluting shares and ending the potential for a squeeze.

B) Ryan Cohen just bought 12% of the company. He's not going to want to significantly dilute that on essentially day 1.

C) As far as I know, they're likely going to offer $100 million in a shelf offering which at this price isn't going to move the needle as that's only 300,000 shares.

At ~$300 * 70 mil  = $21B
At ~$60,000 * 70mil = $4.2T

The entire US economy is ~$20T so you're right, there technically is enough to support going as high as like $250,000/share but that is never going to happen. Even if every share of float was locked in a diamond hand of a WSBer the US government at that point would step in, tell Gamestop to issue new shares at X price and honestly that bailout would be very favorable to wallstreet, like $100 a share. 

There is no realistic endgame that we make Gamestop having a capital value of 25% of the entire USA. It's funny to joke about and meme $69,420 but just so long as everyone understands that it is a joke. If it hits $1,000 count your lucky stars.

Very relevant for GME, as fundamentals and history points down, while recent interest points up. What will decide, is our action. If we are asleep at the wheel, GME falls. If we keep pushing, it breaks up through the upper line, and continues. Another factor is pattern based trading algorithms. They are programmed to act on breaking trends. If GME breaks the line below, they start selling. If the upper line is breached, they buy. So momentum is important. BUY AND HOLD.",32,wallstreetbets,1612054589.0,1612052841.0

But the short ratio of GME is still extremely high.  It takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover. 

I come from Hong Kong, and I stand with all WSB people. 

For those people who are fear. Listen! If the short ratio of one stock is talking about ~100%, we must win provided that all retail investors buy and hold. This is simple mathematics. If you give up and sell your stock now, we lose and the hedge fund wins. Don’t waste the previous effort of bruh here. Strong buy and strong hold.

Please note that it takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover the stock. No fear. Bruh! Disregard what the mainstream media and BS said, and simply buy and strong hold GME. YOLO! Keep chasing our dream. Bring GME to moon or even Mars.

If your broker limits buying GME, please don’t give up and try buying from Sofi and Tradestation. You may contact your account manager of Tradestation for help if you have difficulties of buying GME.

I love you all. Love from Hong Kong.

Mike Santoli wrote a column today with the following note...

"" (Note the GameStop short position has routinely been described as far exceeding the entire share float. This is never true: When a share is sold short, a new long position is created and added to the float. The same share is effectively owned by the original owner and the one who bought it from the short seller who borrowed it.)""

What be is omitting is that the long position is owned at a lower value... Which is the whole problem here. He is trying to confuse readers. The number of shares cannot and will not increase unless the company's board decides it.

They have all the control and information - they are relying on retail investors to get paper hands and start selling when the squeeze doesn’t happen. However with restricted buying on GME can it really happen? I think retail investors would need to hold out and hope for some sort of external intervention to force the brokers to stop restricting.

What we’ve witnessed is probably the biggest bailout of hedge funds ever. EVEN IF halting / restricting buying was because of the clearing house / depository trust company requirements and not RH/Citadel shenanigans, once again the hedge funds were bailed out because they are TOO BIG TO FAIL.

1279,glfkoi8,t3_l8zy5h,"You are correct but let me try to explain in a bit of detail why it doesn't matter.

GME closed on Friday at $328. Only approx 10-12 million shares have ever traded above $328 and not all of those transactions involved initiating a short.

The current short float is about 60 million shares. So you can assume that there are currently over 50 million shares that were shorted and are currently in the red.

If the stock keeps rising (without major drops) those 50 million shorted shares that are currently losing money will need to be liquidated. They can hold them forever, but it's very expensive to hold a short in GME. There are high margin requirements, interest rates are jacked up and there is a high fee to borrow the stock.

At one point, one of the larger short position holders will come to the realization that they cant win and will liquidate before the stock price jumps further and that will start the squeeze.

Insiders usually aren't allowed to have their shares available for shorts per company bylaws, and long instutions would have called their shares from short availablity the moment they saw what was happening.

There wasn't enough buying volume on Friday to indicate that they had covered a ton of their shorts.  Maybe a few %.
