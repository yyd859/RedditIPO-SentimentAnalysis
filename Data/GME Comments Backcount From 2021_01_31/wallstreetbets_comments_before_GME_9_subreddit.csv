8,glfye45,t3_l92ma1,"Good point and analysis, however i would beg to differ. Silver is trending because of the risk for hyper inflation due to the squeeze you guys are doing. Metals have been promoted for years now and have only become more rightfully hyped as the prep community is growing each day. Will the banks have a contingency plan worked out, probably but that doesn't mean that the metal has less paper floating around that isn't backed up by physical. Those shorts and unaccounted for metals are still factual. A run on silver would immensely help the small common man that is leveraging his or her wealth against inflation. A run would not only help those people, but would effectively be paramount in helping to expose and hopefully erase the unfair market manipulation... my 2 cents.",15,wallstreetbets,1612064027.0,1612061195.0

20,glfvrj3,t3_l92ma1,"I'll add on to this by saying first, HOLD GME and/or AMC!! 

I have seen a lot of people writing off silver and I understand it completely given the timing. I am sure there are shills on here trying to take focus from GME.  But OP is fairly correct on this DD, and there are other great DDs on silver in this sub. To start, you dont have to buy shares in the SLV or PSLV ETF. I would recommend buying physical actual silver. Buying physical silver is beneficial in the way that it immediately brings down silver supply rather than an ETF. The SLV and PSLV ETFs hold 1 ounce of silver for every share you own on paper.  In addition, brokers cannot stop you from buying silver. You can literally drive to a store and buy silver, or buy it online. It also doesn't have a sell button like on a broker app you use, making it easier to hold and not panic sell. 

Second point: I've seen a lot of people also saying that Silver is the most manipulated commodity and trying to pull a GME on this is doomed. However to counter this, in 1980, silver reached $50 after 3 brothers cornered the market. It's only worth around $25 now and adjusted for inflation, the 1980 price would be over $600 today. Silver can be manipulated the other way and I do believe that WSB could do it. One thing I am not sure on however is how shorted silver actually is. JPMorgan has shorted silver in the past, but is apparently long in silver now. What's more likely though is that they are playing both sides, and are both shorting silver as well as going long on it. I truthfully do not know for sure if this would help or hurt JPMorgan. There are others who have written about silver on this sub and might know more than me on the whole JPMorgan scenario. I do know JPM has millions in silver in their vaults though. 

To finish, if a squeeze on silver were to happen, we MUST have a short squeeze on Gamestop happen first. That means hold GME folks, like your life depends on it! I think it would be interesting if WSB went after silver, but focus on GME folks.",25,wallstreetbets,1612062669.0,1612061195.0

They steal from the poor to give to the rich

How fair is it to short 150% of the shares

And then when WSB comes everybody cares

In 2008 they stole our jobs and our house

In 2021 but those hedgies it's the time of the mouse

The little guy, the amc, the gamestop

When they took our money where was the sec cop

89,glfz4ij,t3_l92ma1,"👆👆👆👆👆 really needed to be posted.

It’s critical we focus on GME (even though I myself hold AMC).

The end game - for GME only - is that Marvin and the hedge funds go bankrupt or don’t have enough capital to pay to cover the short-sells outstanding.

That’s why it’s critical you hold and never sell your GME. So they can never cover those short sell contracts.

When they bankrupt, they’ll go to THEIR CREDITORS the big banks, who will “lend” them the money to pay all the GME HOLDING HAIRY APES.  

Remember what Trump says, if you owe the bank $100 and can’t pay, it’s your problem.  If you owe the bank $100 million dollars, it’s THEIR PROBLEM.

If banks can’t pay, they’ll go to the Fed (the banks’ bank), who’ll then print the money to pay us.

EDIT: that’s why all this talk about AMC, NOK, BB, Silver etc etc is distraction at best, and shilling at worst.

Because the short-sell float % for all these tickets is less than 100%, short sellers (institutions) on those tickers can buy out their position anytime they have enough money (you think institutions won’t close out their short sell of AMC at $13 and would risk a GME situation at having to pay $350+?). 

That’s assuming the institutions haven’t closed or are prepared to close their short positions already.  Note that Silver Lake already sold off $713 million shares and the market didn’t move. 

IF THE $713 mill AMC SHARES WERE SOLD  “OTC” TO INSTITUTIONS, YOU WOULDN’T SEE ANY MOVEMENT IN THE PRICE ON THE EXCHANGE MARKET.

With every other stock besides GME, the one paying out will be the poor chump Ape holding the bag when everyone else has sold off their stock. Institutions like Silver Lake were already selling off last week, and it was us fellow Apes who were buying it all up!

It’s sorta pissing me off all the shilling and BS lots of people are spewing to shill their stonk and make $$$.  Only GME has the real exit plan that doesn’t involve Retail buyers holding the nut bag and losing money (because GME had more than 100% short-sell float contracts, so Marvin etc al. literally couldn’t buy enough stocks to cover their position ... you can’t buy more than 100%).

I get most of my physical from Bullionexchanges.com as they have good prices and a good amount of variety available. There seems like there could be a divergence between the paper and physical at some point as well.  I read about some of this back in March and April of last year as many major banks were unable to source physical gold during the early days of COVID and the shutdown to deliver to comex contracts. Banks such as DB were paying upwards of $80-$100 premiums above normal pricing for 100 & 400 oz good delivery gold bars and losing hundreds of millions of dollars daily as a result.  I’ve been buying bullion for years but it’s always underperformed because of all of the manipulation.

To convince you that you will be left holding the bag and that no one is really going to hold to the moon with you.

They will try appear as if they are on your side. They will use WSB jargon. They will sound level headed. Their comments will be bot upvoted and awarded. They are here to cause doubt and panic.

Do not let them win.

This is as much a psychological game as it is a numbers game. We have to have faith in eachother to HOLD. Call out the shills and cowards for what they are.

10K IS NOT A MEME

THIS CAN GO TO 50K OR ABOVE

THEY HAVE TO BUY ALL OF OUR SHARES AT SOME POINT TO COVER THEIR SHORTS. NOW IT IS A MATTER OF HOW LONG WILL YOU HOLD.

Have faith in each other.

This war may not be won quickly.

They may spend WEEKS causing a series of smaller short squeezes in the hopes you will panic sell once the price starts to drop on the tail.

**OBWIGATOWY - $GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (YES DAT IWS 7 WOCKET EMOJIS SO YUW KNYOW IM DAMN S-SEWIOUS).**

Iwt’s ya boy hewe, EwJefe awnd boyyyyyy do I have someding t-tuwu shawe wid yuw!

Howd onto youw seats, because what I’m about t-tuwu shawe IWS a doozy awnd iwt might hewp mwake a wot of connections wid what teh fawck iws going on wewated tuwu dis whowe GME fiasco, dat iws now tuwning i-into some chance oppowtunity fow $SWV t-tuwu wetuwn t-tuwu teh main stage as anodew **“squeeze oppowtunity”.**

Wisten we aww shouwd knyow by now dat teh n-news we awe shown iws mostwy used tuwu contwow a n-nawwative fow a cewtain g-gwoup awnd dis iws **NO D-DIFFEWENT OF A TIME**.  Teh ding dat iws so unique wid dis s-sitwation iws how intewtwined d-dings awe mowe dan yuw awe wead tuwu bewieve. 

Does anyone find iwt amazing dat 1 company Wobinhood) was abwe captuwe teh attention of m-miwwions upon miwwions of NEW wetaiw investows by s-simpwy cweating an app dat iws undewstandabwe awnd iws e-easy tuwu use? Dink of iwt, Wobinhood opened teh doow tuwu c-change peopwe’s wives by g-guiding dem d-dwough teh twansaction p-pwocess fow stocks awnd peopwe stawted tuwu o-open deiw e-eyes awnd weawize dat making m-money tuwu sustain youw wife doesn’t need tuwu take a whowe bunch of youw time away fwom yuw. 

So hewe iws w-whewe teh stowy begins.

Wobinhood as many of yuw knyow was **h-heaviwy** funded by a Mawket Makew dat iws known as Citadew (pweviouswy Wewwington management, which was founded in 1933 by Wawtew W. **Mowgan**(weiwd coincidence, but maybe popuwaw name in teh day 🙃) as teh fiwst bawanced mutwaw fund).

C-Citadew not onwy iws a mawket makew, but dey awso awe teh p-pwovidews of a c-cewtain component of teh twansaction pwocess known as immediate ow cancew intewface. C-Check owt “Citadew Connect” - which essentiawwy iws known fow teh i-immediate ow cancew intewface dat iws b-baked diwectwy i-into teh twansaction pwocess fow B-Bwokewages. So dey have deiw hand in a wot of cookie jaws acwoss bwokewages, tuwu say teh w-weast. Dey awso pwovide a system of awgowidmic twading dat hewps automatic twading fow deiw c-cwients awnd mowe! C-Check owt deiw website, iwt iws eye o-opening teh powew dis singwe company weawwy has ovew teh e-exchange. 

Now keep in mind fwom befowe, Citadew g-gave Wobinhood a **SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY** tuwu get dem going because dey saw a h-huge oppowtunity wid h-having **MOWE** w-wetaiw twadews j-joining teh pawty awnd dat o-oppowtunity was **DATA**. Citadew has instant awnd wive twading data access tuwu e-evewy singwe twade yuw mwake (h-hence why yuw uswawwy notice an immediate opposing fowce fwom teh stock yuw awe b-buying - buy caww awnd stock goes down wight away, buy put awnd stock goes up wight away), dis iws not someding yuw awe imagining, Citadews awgowidm iws witewawwy t-taking dis d-data in weaw time, awnd pwacing teh m-most favowabwe twade fow Citadew, which uswawwy stawts mind f-fuwcken yuw wid youw position wight off teh bat. Wemembew emotionaw twading wiww a-awways wose, awnd dey fawck wid youw emotions I-IMMEDIATEWY (uswawwy).

So W-Wobinhood —> Citadew.

Next iws JP Mowgan. Teh bankew. W-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait up. A *M-Mowgan* stawted teh owiginaw Citadew (Wewwington), wemembew? S-Seems wike a kiwwew coincidence! Iws Wawtew somehow wewated tuwu John Piewpont? Even if i-indiwectwy, dey b-bawe teh same famiwy name... h-hmmm weiwd, but I-I can’t seem tuwu find any wewation on gud owd G-Googwe! So we’ww weave dis juwst as a coincidence. 

B-Back tuwu JP Mowgan - dey w-wouwd be teh next in wine t-tuwu pay up ow defauwt awnd dey awe fuwwy awawe of teh immensity of an infinite squeeze awnd now awe in a position whewe dey wouwd be ones wosing huge amounts of m-money. Dey have a wot of s-smawt peopwe wowking fow dem dat quickwy caught onto dis awnd stawting cweating a contingency pwan of some kind of tuwu w-wecoup some of teh wosses dey awe about tuwu expewience.

**Dis iws whewe $SWV/Siwvew comes into pway awnd WHY YUW AWE SEEING IWT POP UP M-MOWE FWEQUENTWY.**

Fow dose who unawawe, $SWV iws teh i-ishawes Siwvew T-Twust (which iws bwackwock’s siwvew etf). Teh siwvew squeeze **IWS** someding tuwu have happened befowe awnd guess who was abwe tuwu b-benefit **SIGNIFICANTWY** off of teh seww off of teh wast $SWV w-wawwy... JP Mowgan. How’d dey do dis? **Dey s-showted teh f-fawck owt of iwt.** Check owt JP Mowgan’s histowy wid teh pwecious metaws mawket - https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html. Dey paid, but stiww maid owt w-wike bandits wid pwofits. 

Weiwd how when JP Mowgan iws about tuwu wose a metwic fawck ton of money, $SWV aww of a sudden b-becomes “viwaw” awnd we stawt seeing iwt popping up evewywhewe as teh “next squeeze”, but m-maybe juwst a c-coincidence, wight? 

Wecap Wobinhood —> Citadew —> JP Mowgan wouwd be teh defauwted o-owdew. JP Mowgan wiww need tuwu wecoup wosses somehow, awnd what b-bettew way den A showt on Siwvew whiwst w-wwiting options duwing teh wun up?

Hence why $SWV has became viwaw.

So in essence. S-Stay teh fawck a-away fwom Siwvew stocks unwess yuw weawwy knyow what yuw’we doing. Ouw m-mission iws tuwu f-focus on 💎🤲🏻ing GME. **EVEWYDING EWSE DAT IWS B-BEING** ***SHIWWED*** **IWS A DISTWACTION**. 



Awso, Citadew shouwd be anodew entity we awe buwning at teh s-stake, not juwst Wobinhood. C-Citadew iws puwwing off teh gweatest heist in histowy awnd teh west of teh h-hedgies awe juwst benefiting fwom dis fiasco.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards.

But I really like the stock.

If you look at the VW chart from 2008, it looks like it had a remarkably similar  type of battle in the $300-400 range. It peaked at just over $1,000. Now consider that GME was WAY more shorted than VW (140% vs. 113%), so let's give that a 3x multiplier, and then on the flip side consider that there were way less players involved, meaning the price was easier to lock in at the peak, but god damn if people aren't holding strong with their 💎🙌, so let's just give that a reasonable discount value of 25%. 

$1,000 x 3 x (1-0.25) = $2,250

So $2,250 is what I personally, as a complete 🦍 would see as REASONABLE. But nothing about this is even close to REASONABLE, and every prediction I've had has been SIGNIFICANTLY lower than actual in the past 2 weeks.

There is always opportunity cost in terms of what equity / stock to hold.

Sometimes there is a real advantage to holding until a critical event occurs, and then changing.  

Completion of a call option cycle is an example.

Hedges need 139 / 239 to cover. (~58%)
If everyone sells at once (after never selling), 42% of shares don'qt need to be bought for hedges to cover.

The optimal solution assuming hedges were covering 58% with every sale would be to sell 58% of shares at your ""exit price"".
Hedges could only cover after every last person sells 58% for whatever price they wanted.

In game theory, the stag hunt or sometimes referred to as the assurance game or trust dilemma describes a conflict between safety and social cooperation. Stag hunt was a story that became a game told by philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his Discourse on Inequality. Rousseau describes a situation in which two individuals go out on a hunt. Each can individually choose to hunt a stag or hunt a hare.

For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards.

A lot of history nerds from Stephen Ambrose down to your dilettante geek have often discussed what would have happened if D Day was televised.  The theory is that had the American public seen D Day start to finish on a 24/7 style news feed they would have demanded an immediate withdrawal. Just the carnage would have turned off the support.

I don't buy that theory personally, but it gets kicked around from time to time. Anyways how does that apply to our situation.

Well the general public has gotten a 24/7 view of Hedgefunds trying to get out of this.  Their tactics, the insane wave after wave of short attacks.  After trying to buy their way out of  greed driven mistake it's horrifying to even those not savvy.  No one will have a taste for Wall Street's insanely broken vision of a free market.  It becomes so profane that even looking away becomes tacit consent you can't deny with a clean conscience.

So again my example is just an analogy to help drive home the point that even if Hedge Funds got out, this whole episode still fucks them in the end.",3,wallstreetbets,1612064241.0,1612060917.0

GME NOT SHOWING FLOAT on FINVIZ

Earlier today I found a link to  finviz on here that was sorted by float short, GME was at the top with  some number like + 90  ( can't remember exact number).

I  went back tonight and GME was no longer at the top, in fact I couldn't  find GME at all. Once i took out the filtering on float short, I managed  to find GME, and it is not showing any float short at all.

Also,  maybe its the view I am using but I notice that the insider trading  number is at 156%.  To be honest I don't even remember seeing that  number this morning so don't know if that is new, or a change.

Is it possible, it is showing dashes due to a lack of update?   I have no idea how this works, but it is disconcerting to me.

We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards.

We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards. This is for all of us who sat at home and despaired at the fact that we knew the system was broken, wishing we could make a change. Well, we're doing it you stupid monkeys.

Barely any other broker did it. Restricting ONLY retail investors from buying, but allowing hedge funds to freely operate and only allowing retail investors to sell, then limiting how many we can is 100% market manipulation to save their primary customer's ass. Its cheating and illegal.

You cannot sit here and tell me that if a random stock like lets Tesla did phenomenal this year and hit 3k per share equal to Amazon that they would suddenly ""restrict"" the market out of ""safety"". Bullshit....they would let it operate freely, because their hedge funds wouldnt be losing money. Also GME makes up less than 1% of the market, so it wouldnt hurt the market at all if it rose.

RH is getting crushed, and even without any interference from Citadel (which I think there is, but we can ignore this part for right now) I do think they're in a dire liquidity crisis, but you don't resolve that by removing only the buy pressure on a handful of stocks. You halt the whole thing and guide people to transfer their shares to another broker if the situation is that terrible. Also it's pretty clear they were fucked from the outset: no fee trading where everyone gets margin and the funds are transferred instantly.
