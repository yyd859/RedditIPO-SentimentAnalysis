1,glfa02q,t3_l8zbtn,"I was going to download robinhood, but I guess I won‚Äôt now.  Is there another app you recommend where I can buy game stock stock?",13,wallstreetbets,1612051256.0,1612051028.0
2,glfa4i4,t3_l8zbtn," An explanation of the importance of setting sell limit orders at $100 and above:    Every time a person shorts a stock like AMC, they borrow X-amount of shares from a broker (Robinhood, Fidelity etc.) and pay interest on the value of the borrowed shares. If a person ‚Äúborrows‚Äù 10,000 shares that are currently trading for $100 per share, the interest if calculated on a value of $1,000,000.  This interest is paid by the short trader so long as his /her position is open. In other words, so long as he / she is in possession of the lended shares.  To lend the shares to the short trader, the broker ‚Äúborrows‚Äù shares from his/her clients. That is you and me, and shares that we‚Äôve actually purchased with our own money.  For example, if you currently own 1000 shares of AMC and do not have a sell limit order in place, your shares are available to be lended to short traders. And most likely, they have already been lended out given the current trading climate.  If this coming Monday you place a sell limit order on your 1000 shares at $100 per share, the broker would need to immediately return or replace your shares to make them available be sold by you. Typically, this would be accomplished by the broker borrowing shares from another client like me, for example. But if I already have a sell limit in place, my shares cannot be borrowed to replace your shares. In fact, if enough of the broker‚Äôs clients have their AMC stock tied up in sell limit orders at $100, the broker would then need to see if he/she can borrow the shares to replace your shares that have been lent from other brokerages.  If all of this is remindful of a legalized Ponzi scheme, that is because it is...a legalized Ponzi scheme.  If the other brokerages also have a supply deficit because of sell limit orders on AMC stock, the broker would have no other choice but to call back the shares from the short trader to replenish your position.  This is where the squeeze happens because at this point, the short trader needs to close out his / her position at market price or the broker will close it out for him / her.  As the share value of AMC climbs, the urgency with which brokerages will call back shares from short traders will increase exponentially.    This is why every one of us needs to set sell limit orders on our AMC positions at $100 per share and up.  If we all continue to buy and hold and set sell limit orders, we will starve the brokerages of shares to lend out to short traders, and we will force the call back of all shares currently shorted.  Buy.  Hold.  Set sell limit order at $100.   \*\*\*\*Make sure you specify GTC (good till cancelled.). This way you wont need to remember to place a sell limit order every day",29,wallstreetbets,1612051321.0,1612051028.0

My uncle was at one time a very successful farmer.¬† However, several years ago, things took a bad turn.¬† My uncle developed health problems that gradually got worse.¬† By the time the doctors came up with a good diagnosis, my uncle was struggling financially.¬†

To make matters worse, my uncle‚Äôs piece of crap neighbor heard of the trouble my uncle was experiencing.¬† Instead of lending a hand to help out on the farm, that guy took out a life insurance policy on my uncle!¬†¬† He figured not only could he end up with my uncle‚Äôs farm, he could make a profit at the expense of my uncle‚Äôs demise.¬†

This utter lack of human compassion did not stop there.¬† That same neighbor started contacting other neighbors, letting them know that they could also take out a life insurance policy on my uncle.¬† Most declined, but some joined in.¬† Then, all of those lowlifes hoping my uncle would go ahead and die, went to the bank and told the bankers that my uncle would soon be dead.¬† As a result, the bankers refused to loan my uncle desperately needed money that would help him get medical treatments and continue farming operations.

As a result, nobody who was in a position to help my uncle would.¬† Those who wanted to didn‚Äôt have the money to help with his treatments and they were afraid to go against the (evil) landowners who all hoped to profit off of my uncles death.

Well, I‚Äôm glad to say that today, things have changed.¬† I was just a boy when all of this started, but over the years I and my friends have saved up a fair amount of money.¬† We went to the bank and bought back my uncle‚Äôs mortgage on the farm. We provided the money needed to help cure my uncle‚Äôs illness.¬† It even looks like the farm has promise of once again being a prosperous enterprise.¬† To make things even better, as a result of my uncle‚Äôs good fortune, he has included each of us in sharing the profits from his farm.

But now we have another problem.¬† The cruel landowners who took out life insurance policies on my uncle now realize that they are not going to profit off of his death and won't be able to divide up his farm among themselves. And they are outraged!¬† At this very moment, they are colluding¬† with¬† the town‚Äôs sheriff to say that the money we pooled to help my uncle should not be accepted and that the farm isn‚Äôt worth what we paid because my uncle was supposed to die and let the farm become  worthless.

We need your help!

Does any of this sound fair to you?¬† Of course not.

I don‚Äôt have an uncle.¬† This story is about Gamestop.¬† The hedge funds spotted a struggling business and made bets against it.¬† This made if even harder for the business to get necessary funding to transform itself.¬† All of you are me and my friends.¬† You saw a business that others have bet against and have provided the funding, even more than is needed, to turn everything around.

Now, the hedge funds are crying foul.¬† They don‚Äôt like it that you decided to go against their evil deeds and they devising ways to force the sheriff to halt your payment to the bank.¬† They are succeeding with some firms such as Robbinhood.¬†¬†¬†

The world is watching.

I have already responded explaining how they are clearly motivated by reasons other than the safety/interest of their clients. I have also asked them who the next person I escalate this too - Financial Ombudsman or FCA I suppose?

EDIT: They have already replied, saying: ""Please be informed that you can go ahead and escalate the matter. But it was done to protect our systems and in turn to protect our client's interest.""

Interactive brokers has been a well renowned broker but it will likely take 5 days or more to set up your account and buy shares. They have a proper trading platform available as well out after hours trading, but they have received a bit of heat from their CEO going on TV and laughing about how they had to stop trading to protect themselves, although many brokers have done this.

If you have a Commonwealth Bank CommSec account, you can enable international trading in your account settings on their website and buy NYSE:GME stock through CommSec.

If you have a St George Bank Direct Shares account you can also buy international shares for a moderate fee per trade.

373,glf8h52,t3_l8z3xa,"Let's say GME teamed up with AMC to put video game arenas in AMC theaters. During the day they could give promotions to kids to come to the arcade under a program of re-socializing kids to undo the psychological damage of the lockdowns (an essential upcoming social cause). At night they could function like video game bars which have been very successful here in Chicago (a currently proven business model i.e. Emporium). AMC already has very nice movie theaters across the country, and GME already has tons of video game equipment. I personally would definitely patronize this venture repeatedly when things open up, and I think many across the country would do the same (and across the world if people could play with/against people in other countries while at these arcades).

You upload your ID and they do your US Taxation Form paperwork for you (takes under a day to setup and costs $5).

Then look for ‚ÄúGME‚Äù and press the green button that says ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù

EDIT: For the past week, Stake App has literally worked like monkey crap (ie. you just got a white blank screen after you entered your passcode).  Express Deposits were removed and normal deposits take 3 days.  You literally couldn‚Äôt trade at all.

They say they‚Äôve fixed the issue with a platform update (took 5 days) so we‚Äôll know Monday night when markets open.

So yeah, I don‚Äôt recommend it actually if you want to do quick buys or close out quickly (exit position) during ‚Äúhectic‚Äù trading periods. No ATH (after-hours) trading on this app, so if something major happens in the market (like GME, and you need to close or open position quickly or at market open, you best üôèüôèüôè).

I'm using Stake and it's ass but it kinda works.

Stake was super slow last week but I was actual able to purchase GME at market.

Idk if its because I had the app and website open and didn't refresh before trading started.

Or whether it's because I didn't do any pre market orders or limits.

Good alternatives would be **Commsec, Plus500** and **Self Wealth** . I can't say first hand, so this is based off other Aussies. But I'm continuing to use Stake because most of my funds are in it and its been working for me, although slow. IG has fallen and only allow for selling. >:(

If you enter a buy price too high it can be cancelled automatically or adjusted to within 10% of market value.
If you enter a sell price too low it can be cancelled automatically or adjusted automatically.

But afaik (and I could be wrong, still pretty new) - you can enter a buy price as low as you want (it just wont trigger if the price never gets that low. And you can enter a sell price as high as you want, it won't trigger until the price gets that high.

The LULD rule there is to stop people doing a bunch of really low sell orders to drive the price down. Or entering a bunch of really high buy orders to try and drive the price up.",1,wallstreetbets,1612074216.0,1612050361.0

But if you buy by limit, you can set the price you want to buy. With limit order, you‚Äôll buy the shares when the stock is at the price you want OR BELOW (ie sets a price ceiling).

Only thing is, it may take time for order to be fully filled if you‚Äôre buying a few shares (ie. It will sell you whole shares as they become available at price you want to buy, so your order may be completed over time in multiple parts). Also you can‚Äôt buy partial shares.  You need set price you want to buy, and number of shares you want to buy, and the app will check if you have enough money deposited.

Never used stop order, because it will sell you the stock at the price you specify OR ABOVE the price you specify (ie sets a price floor). So if you want to buy the stock at stop limit of $10 it will buy the stock for you when the stock reaches that price OR THE MARKET PRICE ABOVE what your stop limit is.

Wall Street shorts have been keeping RIG down for WAY TOO LONG. The fundamentals in Transocean have been great for a long time.
Over a billion dollars of cash in the bank
Strong book of business with solid backlog
Rising Oil prices
US Political winds that are closing down domestic production on federal lands and shutting the XL pipeline. All indicators that lead oil prices higher.
They own this space, no competition!
This is a stock that used to trade for $120-$160 in the hey day. But even in a steady market with similar conditions we see today, it floats between $30-$60!
Look it up, check it out. Make your own assessments. No trading curbs or dumb ass blocking of our right to trade quality companies.
