They will do anything they can to put the seeds of doubt in your mind. To make you scared. To convince you that you will be left holding the bag and that no one is really going to hold to the moon with you.

They will try appear as if they are on your side. They will use WSB jargon. They will sound level headed. Their comments will be bot upvoted and awarded. They are here to cause doubt and panic.

Do not let them win.

This is as much a psychological game as it is a numbers game. We have to have faith in eachother to HOLD. Call out the shills and cowards for what they are.

5K IS NOT A MEME

10K IS NOT A MEME

THIS CAN GO TO 50K OR ABOVE

THEY HAVE TO BUY ALL OF OUR SHARES AT SOME POINT TO COVER THEIR SHORTS. NOW IT IS A MATTER OF HOW LONG WILL YOU HOLD.

Have faith in each other.

This war may not be won quickly.

They may spend WEEKS causing a series of smaller short squeezes in the hopes you will panic sell once the price starts to drop on the tail.

DO NOT PANIC

IF THEY WANT THESE SHARES FROM ME THEY CAN HAVE THEM FOR 42,069 EACH

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards.

This past week should have been an indicator, this mindset is fucking contagious, I've been hooked since I found these guys last August. I got my brother into amc and he was telling me about this subreddit the very next morning.

We're quarantined here, none of us really go and start talking about options and shit outside of the subreddit, maybe shoutout a meme stock, but that doesn't interest people.

If we lose our home, we won't have much of a choice but to talk stocks where it isn't the subject, and more people will change their old attitude towards the market. 

All this being said though, wall street bets is not normally a threat to the system. These kids have given Wall Street SOOOOO much money over the years through idiotic bets, this subreddit spreading is probably the best thing that could happen to wall street lmao. You have to understand that we got lucky, we noticed a large weakness and opportunity and capitalized on it. GME is an opportunity, not anywhere near business as usual. 

Fuck I can't say this enough, a lot of you just made thousands for the first time, you finally have enough money to make options calls like all those reddit kids you've been watching, but God dammit you're going to lose your money if you throw it all back into options or some new meme stock.

We got lucky, and a lot of us made more money than our actual knowledge of the market allows, remember that, and catch up learning before you ruin this once in a lifetime blessing.

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards. This is for all of us who sat at home and despaired at the fact that we knew the system was broken, wishing we could make a change. Well, we're doing it you stupid monkeys.

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards. This is for all of us who sat at home and despaired at the fact that we knew the system was broken, wishing we could make a change. Well, we're doing it you stupid monkeys.

All of what I get I plan to invest into something that will stick it to the hedge funds, but I don't think I'll have enough for the current price of $GME at over $300, when I'll probably be getting around $150-$200 or so (20 stock). I see AMC is low enough that I could buy stock in it, but is there anything else more effective that would be a better use? I will fully admit to being a new member, but I have family who lost a lot due to everything that happened in 2008, and I lost 12k from my 401k from that as well. I sadly don't have more than that to invest (I'm saving up to create a homestead in New Mexico in 1-3 years, and hopefully to start a community afterward of creatives, family, and friends who are willing to move out there). Still, I'm willing and able to invest up to $150-$250 of my money (specific depending on what I get from the Blue Apron stock and my paycheck on Thursday) with the knowledge that I'll be giving it up for the cause. Should I just hold off until another group push that gets announced if I don't have enough for $GME, buy AMC for however much I can buy, or should I buy something that someone else can suggest? I'm not looking for advice on profiting from these funds, I know how to buy and sell penny stock (Blue Apron was at $2.28 when I bought 20 shares, now it is over $10 at close), but I don't know yet how to specifically find what stocks the hedge funds are trying to short. I hadn't even heard of this group until a day and a half ago, or I would have joined it years ago. Apologies for arriving late in the movement, but I'm here to do whatever I can.

Dear Brothers in Arms,

I was thinking if there is anything else we could do to help improving AMC and came up with a simple idea.

While we are not watching TV, should we all keep it turned on AMC channels in order to give them more TV share! Does it have any impact on their fundamentals?

Thanks in advance for giving attention to this post, and if experts and influencers on the matter thinks this is a good idea, please share the idea.

Sincerely,

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us.

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards.
