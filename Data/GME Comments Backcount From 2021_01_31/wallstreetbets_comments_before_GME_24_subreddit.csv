PGE needs to fail and be replaced by whatever the next generation of power supply is going to be, and sooner rather than later would be preferable.

Those assholes are charging me just under 30 cents per kWh simply because the value of the property I rent, RENT, is like $1.8M.

But I just rent the cottage out back. I've got like 400 square feet tops. Yes it's nice to live mansion-adjacent, but not really.

The amount of gasoline I've blown through a shitty chinese generator just to keep my mothers oxygen machine running because a tree dropped a branch 40 miles away is preposterous.

They have a monopoly in the area. They are the Comcast of utility companies, enjoying state sponsorship and massive subsidies. They've had the valley by the pubes for decades.

119,glff8b8,t1_glf8hcu," hey there, I live in rural Nor Cal (2hrs south of Paradise) and I have a weighing in on this, maybe not very concrete, and extremely wet blanket -

The  issue with the grid in Nor Cal is systemic.  If you live on the east  coast, the way power lines are run out here would seem shocking.  In  rural areas very little centralized planning was done, and grid layout  is essentially random.  They used to just tack lines directly to the  redwoods, or cedars in the sierra nevada.  They're slow rotting trees...  I am not exaggerating in the least bit, this is not an outlier  condition, it is the condition of the entirety of California north of  the city people.  No real attention paid to clearing and following  serviceable routes i.e. ROADS, just the shortest linear distance.  This  would be true for everywhere I have lived, Humboldt, Trinity, Mendo,  Nevada Co.  In my neighborhood, the lines cut directly from the main  road through the thick of the woods and  down 600ft of elevation -  crosses a creek - and goes back up 600ft of elevation to reach mine and a  dozen other properties.  Yes, there is a road, a dirt road but there is  one.  These lines were run within the last 3 years.  They will of  course, have to be replaced.

The  amount that needs to be invested to fix the grid here I should expect to  bankrupt any private utility.  But the reality is, they won't fix it at  all.  They'll just keep shutting off the power year after year, as  public sentiment hardens against them.

The  fire season out here is getting to be an emotionally heavy time.  Towards the transition to fall, we get those Diablos winds and it can be  hard to sleep. People truly -hate- PG&E here, it's not a rational  consideration per-se. We want the state to gobble them up, and to fix  our shit.

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

A real deal financial advisor who worked for Goldman, Morgan, and manages portfolios now just spent two hours, livid telling me GME will get crushed, it's a bad thing - on the top of the portfolio he manages for a super wealthy (which was ALL DOWN) IT SAYS:
$Xxx,xxx ""Take the ball and run number"" 

He was livid! At the end of it I said, ""well all that's probably true, but I'm a retard and going to hold anyway because there's a guy sleeping in his truck with $300,000 in GME and he's holding.""

 Bloomberg radio is saying ""light snow Monday Tuesday"" , meanwhile a fucking 8""± snow storm is coming to wall street - ""they'd better be at work!!"" Meaning, they know they're in deep shit.


Lastly, I am yelling from the rooftop:
""IF YOU CAN HEAR MY VOICE, BUY GAMESTOP STOCK, IT'S GOINGTO A $1000""

 Listen, this is a movement I am in support of: it's non-violent, and is clearly an Act of God! ITS HAPPENING ALL AROUND THE WORLD IN THEIR OWN RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES, AGAINST SHORT SELLERS THERE!

Hold for that guy in his truck, and for all the people around the world who need to hear it!!!


I LIKE THE STOCK, I'M HOLDING THE STOCK, CAN'T STOP,  WON'T STOP, GAME STOP.

I have been studying economics in a self-taught way since 2015, I have invested in gold and silver, I have invested in 2019 in Altcoins; I am a vulgar lab worker who has always hated banks and vulture funds for not being able to afford to even buy by saving a house to live in, I have always felt drowned and I know that it is wallstreet economists who have provoked all this, in my case, in Spain. Because I tell you all this, it's because I've always looked for how I could fuck up those thiaromiting pigs, that the people could be organized like WallStreet, I've never seen anything like it, in any book, anywhere, this movement can bend and change the balance of power and wealth. I am a lucky person to keep up with you in economics and to have marveled at your act. I'm going to come to the cause and I'll always have a share of my war-ready capital that you decide to undertake. The WallStreet game is over. Gamestop. Greetings from Spain.
