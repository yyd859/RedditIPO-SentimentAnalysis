This is not a short term investment opportunity. GME has a future to be a big player in a huge and growing industry. GME will be the go to e commerce for everything  gaming related. They will also grow into e-sports and gaming streaming. 

What’s more, their growth is coming out of the pockets of those who don’t own the company (the shorts) and flowing into the pockets of those who do own the company (the 🦍).

After the squeeze, GME will see a huge drop due to people cashing out, but you better believe when this happens, the shots are going to double down ever harder.

Once this happens, and IV drops, this is when you buy OTM call options that don’t expire for years. Why? Because GME does have good fundamentals. It is worth the price it is trading at. There is a future for the company. 💎🙌

GME Share Holder before the bubble were big funds like Blackwater and so on. Institutional investors made 90% of the shares. At the hike of the bubble most shareholders have been private traders. You made the rich so much richer. They made to 3000% profit.

If each share of GME has two owners and a counterparty who is indebted to one of those owners for the value of a share of GME, why shouldn't everyone on the planet spend all the money they can afford to gamble with to buy shares of GME until each share has one owner?  The shorts will buy.  They must.  The question is when, and at what price.  The value of GME has nothing to do with Gamestop and everything to do with game theory.  The shorts placed a wager.  Their reasons for placing that wager do not matter.  Only the terms of their wager matter.  What were those terms?  At some point in the past, the shorts decided to borrow the value of one Gamestop share \*now\*, and in exchange, they agreed to repay the value of one Gamestop share \*later\*.  They had beliefs about what a Gamestop share represents, and beliefs about what makes a Gamestop share valuable, but their beliefs do not matter to me.  What matters to me is that when the value of a Gamestop share times the number of shares an entity sold short is greater than the value of that short seller's current liquid assets plus the amount their creditors will allow them to borrow, the short seller is forced to lock in losses and spend all of their money to purchase Gamestop shares to cover their bet, ending up with nothing and transferring their wealth to the shareholders.  Our target isn't a price.  Our target is one owner per share.  Fuck the shorts.  Let them double down.  And quadruple down.  And octuple down.  More shorts is more money for the shareholders when the shorts get liquidated because they don't have enough assets to equal the value of the shares they promised to repay. I see no reason why we shouldn't continue to buy GME at any price until the shorts have closed their positions.  The value of a Gamestop share is the dollar value at which every short seller has closed their position and each share has a single owner.  No less.",17,wallstreetbets,1612031485.0,1612030877.0

322,gle98rh,t3_l8rws1,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

If you short it down far enough, they lose the ability to borrow at a decent market rate.

In the fine words of J Cole: 

“Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart
Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart

See the people at the top, they get to do just what they want

'Til after while the people at the bottom finally get smart

Then they start to holla revolution, tired of living here, destitution

Fuck that looting, can you tell me what's the best solution?

I used to think it was to over throw oppressors
See, if we destroy the system that means we'll have less of greed

But see, it's not that simple
I got to thinking 'bout the history of human nature

While this instrumental, play
Then I realized something that made me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say

Think about this shit for second, you heard the way

The children in abusive households grow up knocking girlfriends out cold
That's called a cycle
Abused becomes the abuser and that how life go

So understand

Look at the power, but you know what power does to man

Corruption always leads us to the same shit again
So when you talk about revolution dawg, I hear just what you saying

What good is taking over, when we know what you gon' do

The only real revolution happens right inside of you

If each share of GME has two owners and a counterparty who is indebted to one of those owners for the value of a share of GME, why shouldn't everyone on the planet spend all the money they can afford to gamble with to buy shares of GME until each share has one owner?  The shorts will buy.  They must.  The question is when, and at what price.  The value of GME has nothing to do with Gamestop and everything to do with game theory.  The shorts placed a wager.  Their reasons for placing that wager do not matter.  Only the terms of their wager matter.  What were those terms?  At some point in the past, the shorts decided to borrow the value of one Gamestop share \*now\*, and in exchange, they agreed to repay the value of one Gamestop share \*later\*.  They had beliefs about what a Gamestop share represents, and beliefs about what makes a Gamestop share valuable, but their beliefs do not matter to me.  What matters to me is that when the value of a Gamestop share times the number of shares an entity sold short is greater than the value of that short seller's current liquid assets plus the amount their creditors will allow them to borrow, the short seller is forced to lock in losses and spend all of their money to purchase Gamestop shares to cover their bet, ending up with nothing and transferring their wealth to the shareholders.  Our target isn't a price.  Our target is one owner per share.  Fuck the shorts.  Let them double down.  And quadruple down.  And octuple down.  More shorts is more money for the shareholders when the shorts get liquidated because they don't have enough assets to equal the value of the shares they promised to repay. I see no reason why we shouldn't continue to buy GME at any price until the shorts have closed their positions.

Now imagine if Keanu Reeves posted a picture posing with a GameStop store and announces “I’m donating money to underprivileged kids to go to school. Power to the players!” 

Anyone who thinks it’s over because of some charity donations has clearly not done their due dilligence. That’s another major point of this sub. **This is a meme sub. This is not financial advise. Do your own due dilligence because no one but yourself is responsible for gains or losses on the market**. 

We can educate others based on our opinions and our reasoning behind having those opinion.

My opinion is this thing has so much more room to grow. Reason? Viral trend. Company is undervalued with new information from where the shorters initially shorted. The shorts are still above 100%. This price is from organic buying. Not from the big infinite gamma squeeze. 

It’s important we don’t start battling each other over messaging. As long as the messaging attracts people and we’re always ready to educate. The movement will grow. Don’t stun the movement with technicalities that are trivial in the big picture.",3,wallstreetbets,1612038140.0,1612030765.0

There’s so much money laundering in charities you can’t possibly be this naive.

It’s that simple. You giving away money to groups of people that don’t have the same intentions as you.

The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.
So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...
🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.
This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.
TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.
So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...
🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.
This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.
TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

1151,gle9o7m,t3_l8rs31,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

1249,gle9rm0,t3_l8rr11,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

If you don't want to read this whole comment, at least take a peak at the Short and Distort link. I'm never surprised by #1. I'm personally more confused about how 2 and 3 are going unpunished.

**Here are a few of the concrete ways that the institutional investors, brokers, and the SEC have blatantly shit in people's mouths** 

[Short and Distort](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp) (S&D) “refers to an unethical and illegal practice that involves shorting a stock and then spreading rumors in an attempt to drive down its price. S&D traders manipulate stock prices conducting smear campaigns, often online, to drive down the price of the targeted stock.”

* Melvin publishing false reports of covering their calls and running ads on them
* Biased reporting by most major networks (except, surprisingly, Fox News)
* Raiding / botting all GME-related threads throughout every social media platform to stir uncertainty and cause general chaos

The [Alternative Uptick Rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptickrule.asp#:~:text=The%20Uptick%20Rule%20(also%20known,a%20securities%20price%20to%20fall.) “allows investors to exit long positions before short selling occurs. The rule is triggered when a stock price falls at least 10% in one day. At that point, short selling is permitted if the price is above the current best bid”

* This is a stretch, but this could be part of the reason as to why retail investors were allowed to sell but not buy on Thursday..allowing us to exit our long positions but keeping the door open for short sellers (which technically retail investors can do). 
* Regardless of whether the above is true, Thursday between 10am - 11:18am saw a drop from $419 to $126. That’s 70% in 78 minutes. I can’t find the bid prices for those times, but if this doesn’t violate the rule, I don’t know what will. 

The [Hard-to-borrow](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/hard-to-borrow-list/) list “refers to a list – i.e., an inventory record – of securities that brokerage firms are reluctant or cannot allow their clients to borrow for the purpose of short selling. Its purpose is to make transparent their list of the stocks that are “hard to borrow,” i.e., difficult to short sell.”

* GME has to be on this list considering their 120% short float percentage. The only way they aren’t on this list is if they graduated into the “literally not fucking possible-to-borrow” list. Unfortunately, there is no way to confirm since the list is not public, but if GME isn’t included, tell the SEC to investigate...uh..the SEC I guess.

GME shares shouldn’t have been short-able this week (or during the last few months) because they violate the **locate condition** which was specifically created to prevent naked short selling (i.e. do you have a very good reason to short, and even if you did, could we reasonably find enough shares quickly to cover your position?
