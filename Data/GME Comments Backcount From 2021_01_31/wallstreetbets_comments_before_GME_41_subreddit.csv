12,glefq18,t3_l8tzbe,"I ran some retardation through Excel. Correct me where I am wrong. Not FA, do your own DD.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1) most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @250+
2) covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3) if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4) this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5) conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion:
Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher. All paperhands, you are safe to hold, even if it dips all the way down to 1$, three times. Just hold.",339,wallstreetbets,1612036389.0,1612036184.0

TLDR: They will allow others to short your owned stocks and pay you part of the interest generated. They require 250k in the account it seems unfortunately, and IB seems to have a min of 50k. I couldn't find a min for WeBull and their page on it makes it sound like there isn't one. Just ""when it's on this is what happens"".

Normally this wouldn't amount to much for a single stock, but what with GME sitting at 97% short float and 250% short interest this makes for a prime opportunity.

Now imagine the following scenario:

An autist moves their holdings into one of these wonderfully opportunistic accounts and generously allow this hedgies the privilege to borrow their stocks to cover their shorts. Yet for this privilege they will have to pay them interest. Then when the contract is up they will have to borrow from someone else to pay them back. Rinse and Repeat.

So long as they are shorting all of this they are paying interest and as many others have pointed out, much of that is going to other hedgies that are silently riding this wave. They hold the majority of the stock...currently...and so they reap the benefit of the interest being generated on this crazy prices. Would sure be wonderful if the common individual owner was able to profit off this nearly never ending stream of revenue. Never ending so long as they can never get their short positions below 100% and completely close their positions. And it will only get better the more they short and raise the interest rate. So long as said autist above maintains his DeepFuckingValues and never sells they will never be able to use anything but loans to trade around and pay their shorts. Loans on loans on loan on loan on loans....each one with a drip of interest on the tip. Interest that will add up significantly and allow said autist to expand his holdings and that ever increase that pre-release drip of interest.

113,glff7tc,t3_l8tzbe,"Watch out for shelf offerings and PIPEs.

If GME mgmt wants to raise cash, the hedgies will short again in advance, use the shelf offering shares which they get at a discount to market share price from GME management at the date the shelf/private placement is filed with the SEC (this will increase the outstanding shares). 

Afterwards, company's mgmt does a private placement via the investment banks and private equity firms who all get shares at a discount which then allows those shares to hit the market, increase the float, and dilute each shareholder's % ownership.

Effectively, they all short again at these high share prices and then cover with the newly issued shares given to them at a discount while the company raises cash from all this.

Short term share price typically tanks. In the long run, share price can go either way depending on how well that new capital is deployed by the company, etc. All the above is my understanding of how companies raise cash after they are listed post-IPO. I got creamed in the late 90s in biotech from these big money groups doing this and it is all perfectly legal by the SEC excluding any info a company's mgmt might share with the hedgies under the table to keep share price dropping or down until their shorts are covered with their new discounted shares.

8:1 on April 8 2024 Coincide with the Total Solar Eclipse.

A nice 4:1 in 2032.

Here comes a 5:1 in 2042, woohoo!

3: 1 in 2063.

That makes it 1share today = 960 shares. 960X420= 403,200.

But wait there's more! Starting around April 8th 2024 in honor of the total eclipse of the Sun, the dividend is reinstated. GameStop maintains a sweet 4.2% dividend annually. Apply the magic of DRIP and by 2069 1 share will be approximately a reasonable $42,000,000.

I keep seeing your posts all over the place called $822 the top. Covering shorts is not linear, it's fractal, as all squeezes are self-similar. In other words, exponential growth is expected, and your argument doesn't make sense.

The fact you post this all over the place makes me think you're trying to convince people 822 is the top so they sell. I'd expect the next jump to be up to 800s based on the aforementioned self-similarity. It does no good to make people think the shorters have covered in the event the price goes 800+, its just the mathematical principals at play.

292,gleh5vp,t3_l8tvho,"Make sure to check your broker is not loaning your shares,

 either check terms and conditions, and how to stop them if they are. Either speaking to broker directly by phoning them or setting a limit sell stops them from being able to loan your share. If you can set a limit sell at maximum % set it to the maximum and when the share price starts to rise cancel your limit order and re adjust it to new %. For example current price is 350 and your broker allows a maximum of +50%. So set your limit to 525. When it starts to rise and you see it hit 400 cancel and set new limit at 600. Rinse and repeat. 

Why this is important to do

The hedgefunds are making new short calls at higher price selling at $350 then they start a short ladder attack driving the price down to their buy price of $250 (or what ever they set)

Why this is bad

Its essentially giving them more money (ammo) to cover their interest on their other short calls allowing them to stop the squeeze (or reduce how high it can go)

You know when people say that the market is not attached to the economy

The problem has been hedge funds shorting stocks

they're not only shorted stocks they created artificial stocks which is illegal and shorted those as well

Then they lied about it on the news

And it's only January

They're on the hook for half a trillion dollars. Their business model is crashing stocks for profit. Literally no one feels bad for them. Lol.",1,wallstreetbets,1612109956.0,1612035847.0
