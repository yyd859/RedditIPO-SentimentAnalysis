12,glffhp5,t3_l8tczt,"Unfortunately, AMC mgmt couldn't forsee the future like /u/DeepFuckingValue, so they issued a shitload of shares and convertible debt at lower prices, which makes the possibility of a moonshot like GME unlikely.

AMC said on Monday, January 25th, it had raised $917 million since mid-December through equity and debt issues, from the issuance of **186.7 new common shares**.

On Wednesday, January 27th, AMC said it raised an additional $304.8 million by selling **63.3 million additional shares** this week, cashing in on an unprecedented social media-driven rally powered by amateur traders taking on hedge funds that had shorted its shares.

On Thursday, January 28th, private equity firm and long-term AMC activist shareholder Silver Lake and other creditors decided to convert debt holdings to equity in a transaction expected to reduce AMC's obligations by $600 million, but result in further dilution to the outstanding shares.

On Friday, January 29th, it was reported that Silver Lake had sold the resulting **44.4 million shares** all on Wednesday, January 27th at an average price of **$16.05 each**.

So, totalling the above, that is 186.7 + 63.3 + 44.4 = **294.4 mln share dilution** to existing AMC shareholders.   So, total shares outstanding have grown from 107 mln to a whopping **400 mln**!  That is a massive dilution.   That is why AMC is at $13 instead of $50 or higher already.

And it has been reported by Bloomberg that AMC is considering further offerings if the stock goes higher from the current $13 price.

All you retards might have diamond hands and HODLing onto your shares, but just like their over-priced popcorn, AMC is eager to issue as many new shares as possible at the current prices.   Equity buyers are giving a much better deal than the company's bondholders that hold their $6 BLN in debt.

So, if AMC goes higher next week, it will be because of new buyers coming and bidding the shares up higher based on sympathy with GME, esp. if GME makes new highs above 500.   But be aware unlike GME's mgmt,  AMC mgmt, plus the funds that bought the 294 million new shares (minus 44 mln Silver Lake already dumped) at lower prices may dump into the buying frenzy.   I don't remember ever seeing a short squeeze when the company is literally dumping 100s of millions of shares into the market with the promise to dump even more.",17,wallstreetbets,1612054076.0,1612034593.0

1. Sell fake stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread FUD. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions and/or push the stock price down so they can profit once, and then hold a long position on all the stock they now have and profit a second time after u/deepfuckingvalue's DD turns out to be as solid as it looks.

The last resort was to throw Robinhood infront of the infinite liquidity onsalught flying fullspeed at their face. I would wager that they are out of tricks now. 

The true diamond hands are not selling below $42069. When you are standing in front of an infinite squeeze that will erase you from the face of the Earth, any share price looks good, even one that's got a big ""FUCK YOU hedge funds"" written all over it.

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

648,glelw43,t3_l8t6zj,"Two weeks ago I noticed GME go from low20 to mid30 and kept it on my radar. I was still fleshing out my research about its track when it ended up bringing me to WSB for the very first time last Saturday... and the absolute wealth of information, and retardery, that has been shared and cited about the MOASS by all y’all gorgeous autists. My smoothbrain starts becoming enlightened by the community.

Had this sub been an arctic swimming hole, I’d have dove in naked on pure instinct

After about probably 12 hours combined of exhaustive and proper DD, as in how I use it to fit my research style,, by Sunday’s eve I was ready to set a buy at Monday open for 100(I’ve been unemployed since March ‘20 so my portfolio is pretty anemic compared to most of y’all’s, and my perceived personal risk was way to high at the time to commit to a bigger investment.) I got my purchase @ like 91buck/share.
Since then my confidence has vastly improved, and I’ve increased my hold, bit by bit, to 20 shares @ around 140; a comfortable risk for me. 93% of my portfolio was secured in GME by the time the first Wednesday hour of trading was over.

I DO HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY
My invest is a big chunk of my total liquid capital, but I’m fairly confident in MY bullish play

I like to follow a set of tenets like the recycling sign, where each bar supports the message of the one behind it and in front.
1. I will not fund investments with more than I’m willing to lose.
2. As soon as I purchase investment, that value becomes a hypothetical zero sum to me.
3. I am the only one who can determine the value of my investment, it’s not on anyone else to tell me what that value is.

Why would that be, if not because the same hedge funds perpetrating the same short ladder attacks at the same times (and likely for the same reasons)?

It also makes sense logically that hedge funds would assume it was a dying company; pandemic means no movies, plus several major studios are now going to a straight-to-streaming format, which I doubt will go away after theaters open up because it makes their movies more accessible and it makes the studios money. Movies will never be the same as they were pre-pandemic. There will still likely be a market for people who enjoy the theater experience, but the streaming format will inevitably impact the movie industry.

GME hit like 150% and people jumped in and held before they had time to get out. It'll be 20 years before you see this sorta thing again.

First, I’m not a boomer but I’ve been trading for 25 years and have been through some huge pops and drops with the dot com bubble, 2008, penny stocks, etc.  If you’re new to stocks, learn this rule: YOU WILL ALWAYS FEEL DUMB!!  Example: you hold your GME shares and it goes to $1000. You sell, it goes to $2000, you feel dumb because you missed the upside. Example 2: GME goes to $1000, you hold, it goes to $2000, you hold, it crashes to $100. You will feel dumb. Example 3: GME goes to $1000, you sell half — now you’re screwed because if it goes up you’ll feel dumb for selling half and if it goes down you’ll feel dumb for ONLY selling half.  The point is, you have to know yourself. Write down your strategy RIGHT FUCKING NOW and stick to it. Know WHY you are doing what you are doing and every time you second guess anything you did or didn’t do, go back to what you wrote down. You are human and humans have emotions, and this next week will be emotional. NOBODY can ever perfectly time the top. Get that out of your fucking head right now. You ate not selling at the top and you can’t ever look back and think “what if?”  If you are buying shares to send a message, write it down and later when you question why you didn’t sell you’ll remember why. If you’re buying just to make money then have an exit strategy and stick to it. Trust me, the higher this goes, the larger the temptation is to take the money and run so plan ahead, trust your plan, and never look back.

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

This is not a short term investment opportunity. GME has a future to be a big player in a huge and growing industry. GME will be the go to e commerce for everything  gaming related. They will also grow into e-sports and gaming streaming. 

What’s more, their growth is coming out of the pockets of those who don’t own the company (the shorts) and flowing into the pockets of those who do own the company (the 🦍).

After the squeeze, GME will see a huge drop due to people cashing out, but you better believe when this happens, the shots are going to double down ever harder.

Once this happens, and IV drops, this is when you buy OTM call options that don’t expire for years. Why? Because GME does have good fundamentals. It is worth the price it is trading at. There is a future for the company. 💎🙌

848,gledcop,t3_l8t3dm,"Make sure to check your broker is not loaning your shares,

 either check terms and conditions, and how to stop them if they are. Either speaking to broker directly by phoning them or setting a limit sell stops them from being able to loan your share. If you can set a limit sell at maximum % set it to the maximum and when the share price starts to rise cancel your limit order and re adjust it to new %. For example current price is 350 and your broker allows a maximum of +50%. So set your limit to 525. When it starts to rise and you see it hit 400 cancel and set new limit at 600. Rinse and repeat. 

Why this is important to do

The hedgefunds are making new short calls at higher price selling at $350 then they start a short ladder attack driving the price down to their buy price of $250 (or what ever they set)

Why this is bad

Its essentially giving them more money (ammo) to cover their interest on their other short calls allowing them to stop the squeeze (or reduce how high it can go)

Is it a possibility that, because these hedges can remain solvent enough, that they'll just repeat ladder attacks daily to drive the price down, and, taking advantage of priority order flows and high-frequency trading bots, repeatedly buy back the dips at the lowest possible price a little bit at a time in order to cover as many shorts as possible over the next 7-14 days? This would prevent the price from going to the moon, and while they'd still take a a major L, they'd be able to both minimize that loss AND cover shorts? Call it cutting off limbs to save the body.

I realize that SI is possible still high and over 100% of total float, but repeated ladder attacks daily is BOUND to shake enough paper hands to dump shares, possibly enough for shorts to cover a large enough % of shorts to avoid a major squeeze. The only thing that could cut the effectiveness of such a strategy I'm guessing is reducing share availability as much as humanly possible during the next week of trading. 

If that strategy is possible, and in my mind seems the safest for them (mainly due to their ability to stay solvent for so long even at astronomical losses), not thinking the price wont go up from here, but not to 1k or anything, maybe 5-700 and bounce between that and 200s for 7-14 days while they slowly cover shorts.

1. bankruptcy - liquidate Citadel/Melvin; this could be executed in traunches so that it would negatively effect the holdings less (?). 
2. class action - every retail shareholder of GME who hasn't sold files a lawsuit for price and market manipulation, arguing that shady, illegal, and market-distorting tactics are being used by hedge funds. The lawsuit would be a way for the hedge funds to avoid ""failure to deliver"". But still make sure they are penalized to death.
3. Bail out - so in exchange for shareholders negotiating via class action, the government agrees to make-up for whatever part of the settlement Melvin/Citadels' assets can't cover. Part of the legislative package could also include rules on short-selling since this is the 2nd time in 13 years its almost blown-up the economy.

Then we negotiate our price via class-action. It'll be more than Melvin/Citadel can cover and congress pays for the rest. Then they try to plug the legal loopholes that allow 140% naked shorting in the first place.

Also, RH is a major issue. Since it can block buys, I would assume it could block sells too. One of the shittiest scenarios I can think of is RH blocking sells during the squeeze while Vanguard/Fidelity/other whales cash out.

People say to just not use RH, but many have already bought all the shares they can afford over RH and transferring GME shares out of RH could take over a week. A squeeze could happen before then.

948,glhvbe4,t3_l8t3dm,"“I keep hearing that ‘most of the GME shorts have covered’ — totally untrue,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 managing director of predictive analytics. “In actuality the data shows that total net shares shorted hasn’t moved all that much.”

“While the ‘value shorts’ that were in GME earlier have been squeezed, most of the borrowed shares that were returned on the back of the buy to covers were shorted by new momentum shorts in the name,” Dusaniwsky added in an email.

Still, short sellers mostly are holding onto their bearish positions or they are being replaced by new hedge funds willing to bet against the stock. GameStop shares that have been borrowed and sold short have declined by just about 5 million over the last week, marking an 8% dip in the short interest, according to S3. Most of the short covering occurred on Thursday, when the stock fell for the first time in six days.

GameStop remained the most-shorted name in the market as short interest as a percentage of shares available for trading stands at 113.31%, S3 said.

>Robinhood  + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't  allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with  CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in a lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish  them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't  already.

1342,glezfrw,t1_gleik7z,"There were 32k $250 limit buy orders placed Friday. Remember when it hovered around $251-255 for about 30 minutes and slowly creeped back up? 

They didn’t want it to hit $250 because then there would be 32k shares being bought up as it bounced up and down from $250, remember, they need these shares.

The trend almost every day this week was skyrocket, come back down, short attack around 10:30-11 CST, then go back up and level out. You want em to think they’re winning by letting it dip a little, but not so much that it’s hard to bring back up. What happened Thursday when it dipped to $126 is nobody was able to build the wall to keep it from going down. 

I imagine it goes $400+ Monday morning, then drops a little then comes back up and levels out for a bit, hits another spike around 10:30-11 then they ladder it down to almost there the next big buy wall is. 

Wait to see where it levels off after the spike. Make a decent assumption of how far they’ll try to force it down and do a limit order lower than that leveling where you think more people will be bidding limit buys. This worked for me Tuesday getting shares @ $82 assuming they’d try to dodge a $80 bid buy wall. 

Whether you want to be a part of the wall or buy a share is up to you. You can do both, though. Just cancel the wall bid while it hovers and add $1-$2 to it. If it dips continuously, triggering breaker after break, then stops and hovers above an even number (250, 275, 300, etc.), they’re likely buying stock back and forth above the wall to keep it from hitting and setting off buys. If you see this happen, that’s when you go.  This helps you to buy at a low price and helps bring it back up.

I’ve been becoming less and less positive lately. Collective action just hasn’t been working the way I always believed it would lately. To manny examples. Then this. Been on Reddit a while, but joined this sub recently. 

Student loans: 200k (first generation with multiple advanced degrees)
Mortgage: 300k (modest family home in an expensive home town)
Income: 90k (total household)—and feel LUCKY just to have work and be able to pay the student loans and mortgage! 

I am very blessed to have food, clean water, and shelter! 

And... 

Little about those numbers are likely to change much before I have to talk my own kids through student loans soon. Sick cycle of keeping bankers and geckos rich. This isn’t right. 

I’m in on AMC for as long as it takes. 

Tupac: “shouldn’t nobody be out here with billions and trillions of dollars, while some people ain’t even got draws!” 

If I can participate in the elimination of one billionaire, just one, maybe I’ll be able to sleep at night. And maybe they become more human in their fall.

You should see it as wisdom and not regret even though it was a stellar play unlike anything ever seen before. The reality is a lot of people got burned too. The key is protecting capital and not blowing up accounts.  Don’t trade what you can’t afford to lose. There is no medal for getting into debt except for the depression that will haunt your very existence.    That said, godspeed you beautiful tards 🚀🌝🎮🛑",4,wallstreetbets,1612035885.0,1612033865.0
1405,glep7ib,t3_l8t2tg,"I don’t hold either, sidelines.  But want to speak to the holders even if they put in 80$.

I’m about to turn 40.  My birthday party will be a beer and maybe cake, with five family members, some of whom don’t like me, afraid of covid.

I was in cc debt for eight years and paid it off last year.  My CC limit now, if I want, is $20,000 because the banks made so much money on my monthly interest payment they want me to keep spending it.

Now here’s where I want you to pay attention.  I’m SERIOUSLY thinking about taking that 20,000 and putting it all GME.  Not only as a fuck you to the Uber-rich but because fuck, if I lose it I can pay it back over time.  And I’d hold it until 1,000 a share.

I .... probably won’t.  But I share this because there are at least thousands of average people like me thinking the same thing.  And some of us will make that gamble.  The older generation knows how these things go.  If you’re under 25 your children will never live the life I had.

Shopping malls, full.  Movie theatres, full, even for BAD movies.  Small business owners survived for maybe ... at least seven years.  Sure the internet did it’s part but the rich liars bred and multiplied by cheating honest people.  

Management would tell you everything is great but automate things overseas.  Bain capital fucking destroyed Toys R Us.  My son won’t go to Toys R Us.  He has to wear a mask going out.

I’ve seen business owners say they pay their apple pickers 2.00 an apple and then leave the company, “Oh, they only got paid 50 cents an apple.  You didn’t know?”

This is a special point in time.  If you’re young, YOLO is not a joke, it is fact.  Hold you retard fuckers.  Invest you stupid fucks.  It’s time for diamond hands to include having a Word of Steel against short-sellers who complain about things not being fair.

I am not a success but you could be.  You might lose money but your hands and body will live to pay some of it back.  

And .... I used to like going to GameSpot.  Been playing Link 2 and a Link to the Past on Switch.

He said that GameStop is trash it’s closing down. I told him it wasn’t about the company it was about greed. I decided not to get it because I wouldn’t have service once we got on the mountain and I wanted to enjoy the day snowboarding and not worried about a investment. Well I totally forgot about everything and had two great days of snowboarding with my son. I eventually bought GME 135 @ $390. Yes it’s a $39 a share to $390 a share difference. It’s a 500k missed opportunity.  When my son found out he said omg. He felt bad that he said it was a done business. I told him I was still buying he said why it’s so expensive. I told him it’s not about the money it’s about greed and if I can be a part of history in stopping that then I am all in.  Needless to say my son took $1900 and got GME @ $245.

They're either hedge fund plants, fedposting or washed-up boomers and junior mining players who have been irrelevant and underwater for years.

The goal is to crush the shorts and get rich.

Anything other then that, we run the risk of financial ruin.

We're not here in a crusade to beat the bullion banks or crush the COMEX.

That's fighting the boomers' war.

Like most things over the past 60 years, they were to selfish and self-absorbed to do anything about it. 

Epic generational fail.

Don't let these ossified has-beens distract you.

If they were of any use, they would have solved their own problems. Now they want to drag us into their bullshit deals to save them. 

Fuck that, the Turks are in charge now.

We will show them how it's done.

After we win that one, we can circle back and consider bailing them out.

NASA has closed a deal with NOKIA for first 4g/LTE internet on the moon. Literally going to the moon 🚀 
When we build for the techies, it typically means the company is in a growth stage, not necessarily a big earnings per share stage, but shows great promise in the very near future.

I don't know if any degenerates here actually play video games or you're instead busy just rubbing your monster balls with your diamond hands all day...

BUT GameStop offers pre-orders of games.

you give $GME money now, to reserve a copy of a game for later.

payment processes a week before pre order release.

so $GME holds on to your money for now and you get the game when its released. 


but you can cancel your pre-order at any time if you decide you no longer want the game (or up to 30 days after release date). lucky for us, games are cheaper than shares of $GME.

I don't know if any degenerates here actually play video games or you're instead busy just rubbing your monster balls with your diamond hands all day...

BUT GameStop offers pre-orders of games.

you give $GME money now, to reserve a copy of a game for later.

payment processes a week before pre order release.

so $GME holds on to your money for now and you get the game when its released. 


but you can cancel your pre-order at any time if you decide you no longer want the game (or up to 30 days after release date). lucky for us, games are cheaper than shares of $GME.

here is a list of games you can pre-order:

hopefully if you like any games, you'll pre order. just like buying stocks you like.",-5,wallstreetbets,1612034472.0,1612033849.0
