What they should work on is relationships with $MSFT $SONY Nintendo to build a cross platform virtual used game trading marketplace.

For CD’s you trade in and it’s easy to see how they swap, but what about if you have a game you bought on Xbox live, or PlayStation store. What if you are bored with it, wouldn’t it be great if you could sell it back and someone could buy it from you? Then you could have fifa on ps, CoD on Xbox etc and move things cross platform?

MSFT/Sony et al still get licensing for premium content or monthlies for set games but this provides a business for GME going forward long term.

Benefit to the hardware companies is they have dedicated retail outlets to promote hardware, showcase their wares. It will always be better than Walmart/BestBuy.

Essentially they never lose their touch point to retailer. Win-win, and GME has to pay points back to manu for each “trade”.

This wasn’t caused by a Reddit pile on.

GME was a value play at 2.50. The short interest was betting it would go bankrupt which was a risky ass call:
1) they bought back 800 mil of their own debt
2) console cycle - shorts bet this wouldn’t exist anymore, but they were wrong due to new consoles having optical discs.
3) Ryan Cohen wants them to monetize the digital goldmine of user data they were sitting on.

WSB shat on DFV for saying this even though Micheal Burry of big short fame also said it.

The pile on happened AFTER RC raised his stake and then joined the board.

GME was never going bankrupt in 2021 and it’s illegal level of short interest was a ridiculously risky bet on the hedge funds parts.

No-one seems to be addressing this. They go blah blah day traders attacked shorts on defunct stock but there was a serious analystical bull case.

Furthermore, GME shifting to being a tech company means it gets to enjoy the 2020 tech company bubble.

The narrative is wrong. Wish one of these interview people would message me. Took 6K to 250K in options and am holding my shares at least through June when Ryan Cohen may well become CEO but at bare minimum has 3 board seats and 2 friendly ones, giving him a majority to push the strategies he learned building Chewy up.

There is a huge bull case so many people are missing here.

Edit: if you do this interview familiarize yourself with DFVs first posts and Micheal Burrys value analysis. You have the potential to make them sound dumb for saying “it’s some random stock”",21,wallstreetbets,1612069983.0,1612065365.0

""The corporate elitists are putting down the little guy! We will not sell, we will buy and hold. This is about the Hedge Fund Manager Billionaires who made billions profiting off American Businesses going bankrupt. They accelerated business closures and hard working class Americans losing their jobs. I'm not a financial advisor but this stock should make anyone who invests in it a ton of money short term. Even first time stock purchasers should be able to easily use apps such as Fidelity. On top of the fact that you get to defend some hedge fund billionaires that use their money to control our politicians and corrupt our government and media!""

""Regardless of who is at fault, Robinhood changed the rules in the middle of the game with no warning. They were even hit with a violation by the SEC just last month under Trump's rule. Tons of people lost the opportunity to invest and it significantly impacted those who invested in that stock. A lot of average working Americans used that app and were severely impacted financially.There need to be consequences for this.""


""The Billionaire class and Elitists tell us that we are too dumb to make our own investments. CNBC has people on that call us morons and Nazis. That too many of us may bankrupt ourselves because others know how to spend our hard earned money better. However, most of us on the Reddit subforum WallStreetBets are just spending what we can afford to lose. Not saying we're the brightest tools in the shed but if people can spend their money at casinos, lottery tickets, and draft kings than they should be able to buy their own stock as well.""

We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards.
