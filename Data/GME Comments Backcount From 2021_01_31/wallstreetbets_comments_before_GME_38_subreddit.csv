3,glem0f9,t3_l8uvro,"Let's say GME teamed up with AMC to put video game arenas in AMC theaters. During the day they could give promotions to kids to come to the arcade under a program of re-socializing kids to undo the psychological damage of the lockdowns (an essential upcoming social cause). At night they could function like video game bars which have been very successful here in Chicago (a currently proven business model i.e. Emporium). AMC already has very nice movie theaters across the country, and GME already has tons of video game equipment. I personally would definitely patronize this venture repeatedly when things open up, and I think many across the country would do the same (and across the world if people could play with/against people in other countries while at these arcades).

GME is not a meme stock. GME has *infinite* short squeeze potential. Does AMC? No. Does BB? No. Does NOK? No.

&#x200B;

Feel free to purchase AMC, BB, or NOK. But be aware that you *are* purchasing a meme stock then. Sure those stocks may have short interest, but GME doesn't just have ""short interest"". It is **the mother of all short interest.**

GME will shoot **much** farther than any of the true meme stocks.

It doesn't matter if $300 is a lot compared to your buying power. One share of GME for Elon is the same as one share of GME for you. The percent gained is the same. Three shares of GME will very likely beat out any of the true meme stocks.

If you can only buy one, buy one and HOLD. Diluting into other things right now is counterproductive. If you really want to help, go as much GME as you can now, when it can make a real difference.

Check it out: this last week, there was only 1/4 the volume on GME as the week before. That means ITS WORKING, and we are doing it. 

That means that now more than ever you should be buying GME, and make this work even better. You can make a real difference.

So after hearing him call me ""fucking stupid"" when I have a college degree with a major in law, here's what he got me thinking: that MAYBE those of you who have been here while have the funds available to buy multiple $400 shares of GME (say 3 for $1200). So, GME goes up $100, you have 3 shares, you made $300

But US, who are just starting, don't HAVE $1200). But we CAN buy 3 shares of AMC for $17 (approx $45). It goes up $20, were made $60. Little by little, we can catch up to you & STILL we're helping because you know damned well that some of you are buying AMC also.

So those of us who can't afford GME, if we buy a FRACTIONAL share of it, how are we EVER going to catch up to you enough to be able to help you, OR US, to any decent extent in the future if we don't make decent gains?

If MMs continue to lose money, we already be there, they will sell everything (why not, we are at highs on most) and purposely crash the stock market. With the intention of getting public outrage focused on you, us.

This site will continue to make many people a lot of money. However, even more will lose a lot of money. And this type of price action will slowly fade.

There will end up being private accounts with such large followings that these sites will have the ability to run up a stock price. So laws will be passed....

Future laws....
A stock will be suspended if gains reach 100%(or so).
A stock will be suspended if losses reach 50%(or so)
Shorts purposely and actively trying to make a stock price drop through algorithms and such will be illegal. Hopefully!

Then there are the boomers are trying to push the Silver narrative. You don't have to bash one or the other just because you don't agree with them. The slv battle is mostly being fought by the gold bugs aka the boomers aka people with more money than us. They've been inspired by our movements, so they want to stand up and do something right. It's just that they don't believe in buying GME at $400 a share or whatever price it may be tomorrow. These boomers know and believe in Silver because they were around when fiat was backed by any physical asset such as gold and silver. It makes more sense for them to buy gold and silver for what they believe in. Not everyone is an autists who can throw money at GME even if it's at hundreds of dollars per share. Full disclosure. I'm an autist and I bought GME shares for the cause.

My point is stop bashing these boomers for trying to do something they believe in. Let them do whatever the fuck they want with SLV. You don't have to buy if you don't agree. They support our cause and we should support their cause as well.

339,glh18mm,t3_l8uu76,"People have to buy physical silver and take it off the market. This is the very BEST and SAFEST way to break the paper manipulation and help the price of silver get to where it should be. Based on the 1980 high price of $50, simply adjusted for inflation, silver should be priced at around $200 an ounce.......TODAY. But the COMEX uses paper contracts for silver that doesn't even exist, to keep the price down. 

Silver is real money and is the Achilles heel of corrupt fiat debt based monetary system.
The manipulation has been a blessing for those who have been stacking at suppressed prices over the years. Take this soon to end opportunity and get physical silver at these insanely cheap prices before they lose control of the price suppression and the price explodes. Not to mention the demand for silver will vastly increase as the world moves towards electric and solar energy. 

Remember, for every ounce of gold miners extract out of the ground, they extract about 7 ounces of silver. That's a real world gold to silver extraction ratio of 1 to 7..........yet the price is at around 1 to 70. That shows just how insanely undervalued silver is relative to gold.

This is the very BEST and SAFEST way to break the paper manipulation and help the price of silver get to where it should be. Based on the 1980 high price of $50, simply adjusted for inflation, silver should be priced at around $200 an ounce.......TODAY. But the COMEX uses paper contracts for silver that doesn't even exist, to keep the price down. 

Silver is real money and is the Achilles heel of corrupt fiat debt based monetary system.
The manipulation has been a blessing for those who have been stacking at suppressed prices over the years. Take this soon to end opportunity and get physical silver at these insanely cheap prices before they lose control of the price suppression and the price explodes. Not to mention the demand for silver will vastly increase as the world moves towards electric and solar energy. 

Remember, for every ounce of gold miners extract out of the ground, they extract about 7 ounces of silver. That's a real world gold to silver extraction ratio of 1 to 7..........yet the price is at around 1 to 70. That shows just how insanely undervalued silver is relative to gold.

506,glihrhi,t3_l8uu76,"Buy Physical if you want but Comex Futures is the Big Bang

The silver futures market has oscillated between having roughly 100-1 and 500-1 ratio of paper traded silver to physical silver, but lets call it 250-1 for now. **This means that for every 250 ounces in open interest in the futures market, only 1 actually gets delivered.** Most traders would rather settle with cash rather than take delivery of thousands of ounces of silver and have to figure out to store and transport it in the future.

The people naked shorting silver via the futures markets are a couple of large banks and making them pay dearly for their over leveraged naked shorts would be incredible. It's not Melvin capital on the other side of this trade, its JP Morgan. **Time to get some payback for the bailouts and manipulation they've done for decades (look up silver manipulation fines that JPM has paid over the years).**

The way the squeeze could occur is by forcing a much higher percentage of the futures contracts to actually deliver physical silver. There may be very little silver in the COMEX vaults or available to actually be use to deliver, and if they have to start buying en masse on the open market they will drive the price massively higher. There is no way to magically create more physical silver in the world that is ready to be delivered.

With a stock you can eventually just issue more shares if the price rises too much, but this simply isn't the case here. The futures market is kind of the wild west of the financial world. Real commodities are being traded, and if you are short, you literally have to deliver thousands of ounces of silver per contract if the holder on the other side demands it. If you remember oil going negative back in May, that was possible because futures are allowed to trade to their true value. They aren't halted and that's what will make this so fun when the true squeeze happens.

Edit for more detail: let’s say there’s one futures seller who gets unlucky and gets the buyer who actually wants to take delivery. He doesn’t have the silver and realizes it’s all of a sudden damn difficult to find some physical silver. He throws up his hands and just goes long a matching number of futures contracts and will demand actual delivery on those. Problem solved because he has now matched the demanding buyer with a new seller. The issue is that the new seller has the same issue and does the exact same thing. This is how the cascade effect of a meltup occurs. All the naked shorts trying to offload their position to someone who actually has some silver. My goal is to ensure that I have the silver and won’t sell to them until silver is at a far higher price due to the desperation.

The silver market is much larger than GME in terms of notional value, but there is very little physical silver actually readily available (think about the difference between total shares and the shares in the active float for a stock), and the paper silver trading hands in the futures market is hundreds of times larger than what is available. Thus when they are forced to actually deliver physical silver it will create a massive short squeeze where an absurd amount of silver will be sought after (to fulfill their contractually obligated delivery) with very little available to actually buy. They are naked shorting silver and will have to cover all at once and the float as a percentage of the total silver stock globally is truly miniscule.

GME shows the power the little guy has when they work together and show the fragility and fraud of the current financial system. GME may very well mark the beginning of a new era with regard to information and power in financial markets. But GME is not important, a hedge fund or two will get liquidated, a few redditers who sell the top will make worldly returns but gme will still be a failing company and nothing will change in the financial world 

What if I told you there were other assets far more shorted than the 138% that GME is, assets whos price is suppressed and managed to uphold the current, dying, corrupt, broken fiat ponzi scheme? I am of course talking about gold and silver.Gold and silver are suppressed in similar ways to how gme had more stock sold than actually exists. Banks sell contracts of gold that do not exist on the comex and put up massive sell walls when ever there is a price increase to manage the price of gold higher and not let it escape higher on a rip tanking confidence in the dollar, they then close these contracts in cash or roll them over with more paper gold. Rough estimates suggest that for every ounce of gold there are 88 claim checks on it, or 88 ounces of paper contracts. For silver that figure is roughly 185 times. 

To put that more simply a run on the exchanges and bullion banks to cash in the paper contracts for real physical metal would cause a 88x short squeeze, and they have so little physical metal it would only take one or two large orders for the comex to be completely empty 

Understand this: More gold is traded every week than has ever been mined in all of human history! 

If a few whales from reddit  actually bought gold futures contracts and demanded their delivery, in a similar fashion to gme they collapse central banking. Let that sink in, we have that power if we work together. This was about showing ((them)) we have the power.

860,glfazhr,t3_l8urk8,"Do both at the same time. Multiple fronts. Silver is the end game to make multiple hedge funds and banks collapse against their naked shorts. This is real. Many of us have been anticipating something like this for years, why shouldn't it be a worldwide event where people demand that their worthless fiat currency is exchanged for the TRUE tangible value of silver (and gold by extension, but silver has much more room to climb to meet the historical 15:1 silver:gold ratio)?

SLV ETF had the largest daily inflow of all time Friday. If you truly want to collapse the system, precious metals, specifically silver, are the way. COMEX has only 90 million registered silver ounces, if every single person in the United States alone bought 1-2 ounces on the many public exchanges out there (Canada maple leaves, Australian kangaroos, South African Kruggerands, \[over priced\] US silver eagles, etc) then you would collapse the banking sector with epic naked short futures contracts on the market.

The key is to buy physical silver coins or bars, or symbol PSLV. Side bets on SLV or silver futures are fine too, as long as the physical is gobbled up. It can truly be done. It would only take a fraction of the folks that hopped on the GME trade to make this happen, give the market capitalization. I use SD Bullion site, JM Bullion site, or APMEX site.

This is a well timed trade, each year many of us buy silver in late January after the February gold contract expires and the FOMC is finished, that was this week WED-FRI.

Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period. 


2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY  know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims /  good guys.


3. Robinhood  + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't  allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with  CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in a lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish  them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't  already.


4. Hedges  might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to  assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you.  Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.


5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to  WAIT. 


6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.


7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.


8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use  Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give  80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.


9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees, and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

911,glf4037,t3_l8urk8," Since wall street, CNBC, and other experts are so keen on giving us ""advice"", I have some advice of my own for Melvin and his hedge fund buddies:

Maybe you think you can out last us, maybe you think you can double/triple/quadruple down and hold on long enough for us to lose interest or get scared and sell. After all, no rational actor will take such an insane risk for so long, right?

**THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.**

That's the thing, most of us here are not rational actors. Rational actors don't call themselves retards and wear it as a badge of honor. Rational actors don't revel in seeing massive losses (it's called loss porn, look it up). And rational actors definitely don't dump their entire savings and/or retirements into this. Some of us are even willing to ride this thing to the peak and back down just to send a message.

Sure some of us will sell at a low enough price that doesn't hurt you so much, but you've shorted GME so much that there's nowhere near enough of them to cover your positions. The rest of us will just keep on holding until the squeeze happens, no matter how long it takes. After all, we already own the stock, it costs us nothing to just hold onto it.

Meanwhile, how much is it going to cost you to hold onto your short positions? How much is it going to cost you to try and force the price back down, only to see it rebound almost immediately after? Millions? Billions? You guys listen to money, so let me talk to you in terms of money. On Friday Jan 29, GME closed at $325. If you cover all your short positions now you will lose millions if not billions, yes. But how much more will you lose if you continue to pay interest on your outstanding shares, and how much more will you lose if the price rises to $500? $1000? $5000? If you cut your losses now, you can save billions in the long run.

Now you ask, ""Won't that trigger the short squeeze, just like you retail investors want?"" Yes, yes it likely will. But the thing is, you would have gotten off light compared to the other hedge funds that are still clinging to their positions. Maybe you think there's some kind of honor amongst you and your hedge fund friends, and you can all tough it out together. In that case, let me remind you about how Lehman Brothers got carved up after they went bankrupt in 2008. Have no doubt that your ""friends"" will do the same to you if you go down. While you're doing the math on how much you stand to lose, they're doing the same, and they will come to the same conclusion: The sooner you get out, the less you lose.

**The squeeze will happen. The more you try to prevent it the more momentum you put behind it.**

The longer you draw this out the more it's going to cost you. So cut your losses now and get out, or stay in and potentially lose it all when the squeeze comes. Who knows, maybe you can even carve up some of your buddies at the end of all this. Just remember, they're thinking about doing the same. After all, the first to leave loses the least.

1060,glewyj0,t1_glejln8,"silversqueeze is about actually taking the GME approach to what is the biggest manipulation of them all, silver is the Goldman Sachs/JP Morgan mother lode.

Basically silver has been manipulated down in value for 100 years so that the Fed can print endless money without the money going down in value. To support this the big banks are all short silver, it's the biggest short on the planet.

To take this back from the banks so that their money manipulation ends, we need to short squeeze silver.

GME is the entree, silver is the real target.

Hold GME for sure, make them suffer, and once you're done, take those profits and come to attack the boss level.

The twitter posters on silver squeeze aren't hedge funds. COMEX, JP Morgan etc are all trying to stop the silver squeeze with short attacks.

Silver is the natural climax to the GME revolution. Please join when ready.

Love what you've done to GME and Melvin, but there's much bigger fish to fry when you're ready.

Here you might be able to ascertain with your big stonky brain that digital purchases like video games and Netflix subscriptions actually have next to zero raw materials or delivery costs once the product is created because you can make infinite copies of these things for nothing more than the cost of the electricity it takes to send over the 1's and 0's.

Can we hit 1K? Sure. In fact, I'm betting on it. 

Can we hit 5k? Again, sure. It will take more effort but it's possible if people hold. This is closer to my target.

Can it hit 10K? Maybe? I'm not holding my breath for that to happen to be perfectly honest. And being real for a minute. If we did get here then most people would be selling. There's just too much profit to be made for people at that point. Even people with a single share would be close to earning 5 figures in profit. 

Can it hit 50K? In my opinion, no. Downvote me all you want. Call me names, a shill, whatever. But people need to be realistic. And even if that price is a meme, it doesn't help spreading false hope like this. I believe their market cap would be close to 3.5 TRILLION dollars if we hit that point.  

Maybe we could get there. If everyone held and no profits were taken. But that won't happen. People will sell, gains will be realized. And the repercussions for the global economy would not be good regardless. Public support for this ""cause""? Gone.

1718,glf24wp,t1_glf1bls,"So yes and no. 

Puts are valued MOSTLY with implied volatility. The more a stock shoots up or shoots down the higher volatility. But also the flatter a stock moves the lower volatility. 

What this means is last year or 6 months ago or even 2 weeks ago if you bought calls the ballooned exponentially getting GME to the price we are at now. Because not only did stock go UP but because it went up so fast volatility shot up. It went from 160% to 600%. This is HUGE. 

So now that volatility is high when stock eventually comes back down (lets say after the short squeeze) you will make money but you won't make 80000%. You might just double or triple. I encourage you to play around with some option pricing calculators to see what return you can expect if stock were to go back down to $80. 

But yes I plan to personally buy puts when I think we are at the peak and make at least some additional return coming back down knowing the IV crush will hurt gains if stock doesn't fall as fast as it went up.",14,wallstreetbets,1612047248.0,1612038079.0

Lets keep something clear. The ones who nearly broke the market was Melvin and other HF who have no idea what good risk management is,  doubling and tripling down on their short positions.  


The free market should guarantee that these poorly managed companies go out of business and their funds go to the winners (us). If there is a capital issue that needs government bail-outs it should be us who get the bail-out not them.  


Don't be scared when they talk about crashing the economy. Demand the government let the HF fail and bail-out the investors, (us). Fight back against any potential bail out and keep highlighting the fact that the HF shorted over 140% of the stock.
