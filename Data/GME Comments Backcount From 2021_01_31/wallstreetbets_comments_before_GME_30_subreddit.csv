1,glevxf9,t3_l8wwrs,"I  was a little late to the party, and as medical residents don't earn  much where I work (France) and I have a student loan, I could only buy  10 shares.

I'm a pediatric oncologist resident and my profits will go to my department.

With  the COVID situation, a lot of stuff has been shut down for the sick  kids. We must face every day longer and longer delays for the surgeries,  and it's really concerning. People from the different associations for  the kids (clowns, music teachers, gym teachers, ...) no longer can visit  the kids because of COVID restrictions. And there is less and less  money for our department. We are understaffed. They are less gifts for  the kids. A lot of things need renovations (rooms, various medical  equipments, ...).

And when I see  those hedge funds, making billions and daring to call us  ""unsophisticated people that don't deserve a win"" that makes me sick.

And  today, you retards have given me the opportunity to take a little to  the strong and rich of our society, and give it back to the most  vulnerable and unlucky people.

I'll hold my shares to the end 💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌

I  put what I could to buy those few shares, even if I need to watch  closely my budget in the next months if I lose it all. But at least I've  tried and I've done what I thought what the right thing to do.

they probably know that many are asking themselves if they should sell at 1k or not what the hedge funds might do it probably let the price go up to 1k and make another ladder attack to make it seem like the squeeze has happened, therefore making other people sell their positions.

Given all the activity this sub has seen lately, this may get lost into oblivion and that's okay.

Let me start of by saying that my account is only a few days old - in fact, I only created an account when WSB temporarily went private. However, Reddit has been my staple for information, jokes, wholesomememes, motivation, nsfwgifs and a lot more for more than 6 years.

And, I just want to let you know I am holding on to what little I've got, praying, cheering for you all and supporting in my own way. I may not afford to buy a billboard or a fly a plane to express my feelings - I may not even have the smarts to write a witty meme or two. Hell, I don't even know how to add those clever ""diamond hands"" icons (can someone teach me?). But, I can assure you that I've got your back. WE, have your back.

The events that've transpired from the past few days had made me realise that now might be more important than ever for me to write this - although it has taken me a thousand edits to conjure these few simple words.

AND, I am certain there are many like me who may not post about how many stocks they've bought, how much they've lost or gained and how excited they are to go to the moon and beyond, but I can can assure you they are holding.

WE are with you on this, though you may not see us. WE are with you on this, though you may not hear us shout. WE are with you on this all the way.

Good luck and god speed.

I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

299,glex9m0,t3_l8wwrk,"I ran some retardation through Excel. Correct me where I am wrong. Not FA, do your own DD. Posted this a bunch, you can find rebuttals all over.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1. most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @ 250+
2. covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3. if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4. this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5. conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion: Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher. All paperhands, you are safe to hold, even if it dips all the way down to 1$, three times. Just hold.",4,wallstreetbets,1612044852.0,1612044113.0

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your $GME shares.

ALWAYS check the up/downvote ratio and read the comments before getting swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh how desperate they now have become.

Given all the activity this sub has seen lately, this may get lost into oblivion and that's okay.

Let me start by saying that my account is only a few days old - in fact, I only created an account when WSB temporarily went private. However, Reddit has been my staple for information, jokes, wholesomememes, motivation, nsfwgifs and a lot more for more than 6 years.

And, I just want to let you know I am holding on to what little I've got, praying, cheering for you all and supporting in my own way. I may not afford to buy a billboard or a fly a plane to express my feelings - I may not even have the smarts to write a witty meme or two. Hell, I don't even know how to add those clever ""diamond hands"" icons (can someone teach me?). But, I can assure you that I've got your back. WE, have your back.

The events that've transpired from the past few days had made me realise that now might be more important than ever for me to write this - although it has taken me a thousand edits to conjure these few simple words.

AND, I am certain there are many like me who may not post about how many stocks they've bought, how much they've lost or gained and how excited they are to go to the moon and beyond, but I can can assure you they are holding.

WE are with you on this, though you may not see us. WE are with you on this, though you may not hear us shout. WE are with you on this all the way.

Good luck and god speed.

PS: This is not a financial advise (it clearly isn't) and I am not a financial advisor (I am clearly not). So, do what you heart tells you to - play games, watch a movie or type an email on your phone.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)

""What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode, is to not do anything remotely truthful.  Because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new view, to create a fiction.""  - Jim Cramer, hedge fund manager 2006

""Then you call the (Wall Street) Journal and get the bozo reporter in Research in Motion and you would feed that (rival) Palm's got a killer it's going to give away.  These are all the things you must do on a day like today, and if you're not doing it, maybe you shouldn't be in the game.""  - Jim Cramer, hedge fund manager 2006

 “It might cost me $15 million or $20 million to knock RIM down but it would be fabulous because it would beleaguer all the moron longs who are also keying on Research in Motion.""  - Jim Cramer, hedge fund manager 2006

[https://www.reuters.com/article/cramer-interview-idUKN2036292620070320](https://www.reuters.com/article/cramer-interview-idUKN2036292620070320)

""A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... meaning I needed (a stock) down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures.  It’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game.""  - Jim Cramer, hedge fund manager 2006

""Who cares about the fundamentals?  The great thing about the market is that it has nothing to do with the actual stocks.""  - Jim Cramer, hedge fund manager 2006",20,wallstreetbets,1612058618.0,1612044113.0

TLDR: I think your missing some key assumptions under your math. The brokers are simply the head of the hydra. 

&#x200B;

There is one key difference between this and Tesla. DTCC! Apparently they required brokers to put up 100% of the trade value, usually this value is something like 1-10%. I'm not going to bother looking up the numbers for Tesla (if they are even available), but that puts the amount of cash that the brokers need at 15.4B vs 34B needed for Wednesday, and we can assume that this value would have ballooned on Thursday if were not for the shutdown. 

&#x200B;

I am not exonerating any of the brokers, they are all culpable as fuck. IBKR basically admitted to coordinating this with all the players. It's very clear here that Robinhood is being set up as the fall guy, the real issue here is the very heart of the beast. Robinhood is simply a head of the hydra. The only way this changes long term is if Americans demand change in oversight and regulations. DTCC is supposed to be a regulator, but is very much in bed with Wall St, fuck DTCC is part of Wall st.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1. most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @ 250+
2. covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3. if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4. this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5. conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion: Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher. All paperhands, you are safe to hold, even if it dips all the way down to 1$, three times.

The other thing you might be missing is the long/short balance of the trade.  I believe it's the case that Robinhood only needs to post collateral per security, not per trade.  That means that it's only the net buying (= shares purchased - shares sold) that would impact the collateral requirements.  It seems possible that most of RH's volume was buying, and therefore $GME became special for two reasons (100% collateral requirements + asymmetric trading profile on RH).

I still think RH's actions were very sketchy, if only b/c their conflict of interest would definitely incentivize them to find *this* particular solution to the problem (limiting buys).",7,wallstreetbets,1612072515.0,1612043926.0

BROKER MARGIN REQUIREMENTS are NOT the same as the DTCC collateral requirements.  At NO POINT was Tesla's collateral requirement for any broker higher than 1-2%.

Margin loans are given by brokers using equities and cash as collateral.  With those loans, a broker's clients can purchase additional securities that the broker can margin call and/or liquidate according to their policies.  DTCC, on the other hand, acts as an escrow for stock trades and requires collateral from the buy side of the trade for the T+2 days it takes the trade to close.",2,wallstreetbets,1612114149.0,1612043926.0

Shorts don't expire. The holders pay interest based on current stock prices. That's the pressure of the squeeze, stock goes up and short pays more interest. You're asking at what point do they give up. That's hard to say.

But neither the web nor app are allowing me to view any previous statements.  Robinhood doesn't email statements, only links to them when they are available (hah).  So I'm SOL on transferring at the moment.  


But look at the [curious fucking page](https://lisacookstudio.com/robinhoodreview/robinhood-account-title/) I found while trying to find answers.  It's copyrighted 2021, full of pro-Robinhood information, but punctuated with terms related to transferring/closing accounts.  Going to the [base directory](https://lisacookstudio.com/) shows 848 pages full of articles with different terms attached, completely unrelated to the content which just spews pro-Robinhood propaganda.

1145,glfrsqy,t3_l8woiw,"I'm here to help new investors get an idea about setup and settlement times at Fidelity.

1.) Setup a new non-retirement brokerage account their website or mobile app. The account you open, there's no fee to open, no maintenance or annual fees, no fee to buy or sell stocks (online/mobile app), no fees for statements/tax forms, no fee to close account, no fee for low balances, no fees to transfer out/in, no bank wire fees from Fidelity, and supported by 24/7 customer support. Fidelity does have a mobile app you can download and use at no additional cost as well to open accounts, do research, and trade.

1A) While setting up an account it'll ask you to choose your core/cash position. Interest rates are close to zero because of coronavirus situation in March 2020, so there won't be DRASTIC differences on interest rates (0.01-.4% differences roughly probably research further if you'd like to) on either position of the cash at the moment but insurance on your cash will be different (FDIC vs SIPC) and who that insurance is backed by (government vs banks)

2.) Important! Link your bank for EFT for to transfer into your new account. Major banks link instantly. Small regional banks or credit unions USUALLY take longer to link and verify and will go under a pre-note approval period that takes a WEEK IF AND ONLY IF they don't link immediately. If your credit union or small regional bank doesn't link instantly and goes under pre-note, you can deposit cash faster from your credit union or small regional bank (any bank for that matter) by using mobile check deposit on Fidelity's mobile app and take pictures of your check to deposit money from your bank. Mobile check deposits done prior to market close at 4 pm Eastern Time will post SAME DAY (just don't wait until last 15 mins of market open if you want it in that day to trade). Last option is to wire money in from a bank using Fidelity's incoming wire instructions posted on their website. A wire is an instant transfer started at your bank that settles same day if also done before stock market closes at 4:00 pm Eastern Time (again don't wait until just prior to market close either). Your bank may charge you a fee for wire transfer tho so I recommend this option only as last resort if other above options aren't at your disposal. Once you transfer money into Fidelity from your bank via EFT/mobile check deposit/wire, if done PRIOR to market close, it's available to trade right away to buy. If the transfer is done AFTER the market is CLOSED, it will be available the next BUSINESS DAY to trade to buy at 8 am.

3.) Sign up for real time quotes in the account features section of Fidelity or once you setup your account to get real time price movement instead of 15 min delayed quotes!

\*\*\*Caution! \*\*\*

1.) Your Robinhood account is automatically setup for margin usually. Fidelity accounts DON'T automatically come with margin. You'll have to apply for margin on the account features section if you want to apply. NOT RECOMENDING MARGIN, MARGIN is ONLY needed if you want to trade with UNSETTLED FUNDS. IF you don't sign up for margin, please be cautious of GOOD FAITH TRADING VIOLATIONS which is usually from buying and selling with UNSETTLED FUNDS!! Additionally, you also have to apply for options trading and they will approve you up to certain levels based on finances, risk tolerance, and investment experience.

2.) You can transfer your account from Robinhood but it'll take 3-5 business days via ACAT which just means it's an electronic transfer. ACAT transfers from Robinhood freeze your ability to trade stocks or invest cash already at Robinhood once initiated for the duration of 3-5 business days, that is until everything transfers and settles to Fidelity. Once the transfer is started, you can only cancel through Robinhood once its been injected into Fidelity's system.

\*\*Please note!!! If you attempt to setup an account at Fidelity and it says you are already registered but you don't actually have active accounts there currently, you probably worked at a company in the past and your relationship with that company is still on file!! Make sure you're prepared for verification questions and know the month/year of your date of HIRE and date of SEPARTION with the company when you call in to a rep that will help you get everything setup. Expect hold times since it's tax season and due to the GME movement.

\*\*Why Fidelity?

\- Best price execution/speed/improvement in the financial industry. Robinhood is being sued for shady price execution/order flow. Free tools/webinars/learning center for research on Fidelity's app/website. Fractional trading is available but not on GME, AMC, etc because of volatility. If you're an active trader they have ""active trader pro"" software to download on your computer for advance charting by active traders and very competitive margin rates. You can trade a broad range of investments ETFs, penny stocks, OTC, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, CDs there if you're into other investing. Cryptocurrency is still NOT tradeable there tho. Fidelity also has ZERO expense ratio mutual funds for investors. ALL mutual funds have no minimum to get started. Lastly, they're rated highly in the industry.

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE AND ONLY MEANT TO HELP PEOPLE GET STARTED AT FIDELITY!! THERE'S NO RECOMMENDATION OF INVESTMENTS!! ONLY HOW TO START AT FIDELIY AND WHAT TO EXPECT!!",3,wallstreetbets,1612060565.0,1612043485.0

1252,glexj5p,t3_l8woiw,"I ran some retardation through Excel. Correct me where I am wrong. Not FA, do your own DD. Posted this a bunch, you can find rebuttals all over.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1. most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @ 250+
2. covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3. if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4. this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5. conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion: Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher. All paperhands, you are safe to hold, even if it dips all the way down to 1$, three times.

Sure their UI and mobile app leaves a bit to be desired, but they've come a long way since for a long time now. And [Fidelity ATP](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/advanced-trading-tools/active-trader-pro/overview) is always solid for those who trade for a living (though TOS has some nicer elements/tools).

But the most important thing for the average layman with Fidelity is that they are on YOUR SIDE when you make a trade. They're not trying to front run your shit like RH to make extra money from Citadel with poor order execution. Robinhood has been fined *multiple times* in millions by  FINRA for poor customer executions.

Fidelity does not attempt to route your order to MMs to make money. They don't even take order flow payments whereas most brokers do. They have fucking 3 tril AUM, they don't need peasant money. They [commit to execution quality](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/execution-quality/overview).

This means, while you certainly pay $ for commission on stuff like options, you will reap savings in the long term from better order execution and can even confidently do MARKET ORDER for high liquidity stuff w/o worrying about getting a bad price for your buy/sell. 

Example from one of my more modestly traded option account:

https://i.imgur.com/gi78KtW.png

So in Jan I paid apparently $219 in commissions for options opened/closed in this account. But the price improvement saved me about $6k. This matters when say... you buy an AMZN contract that cost $4k each and the bid/ask spread is $100 to $300. The execution of the price matters. That might be your whole profit during a quick scalp.

It's especially more so for GME while its volatile. I was able to grab GME during some halts with market order and trust that Fidelity will attempt to get me the best price possible during that moment. It's not going to always be perfect as sometimes you'll get fucked by a quick ask that scoop up your market order - but at least you'll know Fidelity isn't going to try to fuck you over to make an extra money for MMs like Citadel.

Finally, through this entire mess - Fidelity has not restricted their customers even though GME/AMC has been consistently the #1 traded stock by their customers in the past few weeks. Because they do their own fucking clearing and aren't beholden to a third party:

GME has the higher ceiling and a massive short squeeze is more likely since so many fucking people are already in and appear committed to holding for an insane sell price.

Once they transfer, I'll sell RH stocks and buy a few at a time on fidelity, so not too get robbed by a batch sale in RH where I ask market value at 320 and it sells at 250. 


Once I have my fidelity account in line with my RH account, I'll call out RH and send the order to transfer back to my bank and then pay off whatever I borrowed from the pawn shops and loans, and forget I gave head to jons at the wendy's. It might cost a few bucks in services and time, but I can't trust RH to not sell my shit at the price I demand. If GME hits 4k, they'll find a way to batch sell to get my 4k (or whatever, just an example of a limit sell), down to 2k. 15 minute pauses are a gameplay for them now. They might even go so far as to try and use your RH email/password to login to another broker and sell for you. I just don't have enough in my bank account to buy what I have in RH, bit RH will give me whatever cash I have there. I can use their fucking debit card they sent me (which seemed pretty I might say, but fuck em).


They have no shame, and hubristically broke the law in front of everyone, because they know max penalties (980M, plus lawyers plus losing RH altogether), are STILL even less than what they are losing. Expect every hacker that can be bought off to act, every rule to be broken, every legislator to be pressured, fuck, at this point, expect a bomb threat on wall street to delay trading.
