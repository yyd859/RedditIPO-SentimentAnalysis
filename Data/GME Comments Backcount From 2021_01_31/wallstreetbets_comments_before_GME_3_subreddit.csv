THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards. This is for all of us who sat at home and despaired at the fact that we knew the system was broken, wishing we could make a change. Well, we're doing it you stupid monkeys.

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards. This is for all of us who sat at home and despaired at the fact that we knew the system was broken, wishing we could make a change. Well, we're doing it you stupid monkeys.

It would certainly be a good idea for the company to sell some stock in this environment to reduce their debt and try to expand their online presence or move the business in new directions that have better prospects.

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards. This is for all of us who sat at home and despaired at the fact that we knew the system was broken, wishing we could make a change. Well, we're doing it you stupid monkeys.

1185,glg3auc,t3_l941d9,"An explanation of the importance of setting sell limit orders at $100 and above:  

Every time a person shorts a stock like AMC, they borrow X-amount of shares from a broker (Robinhood, Fidelity etc.) and pay interest on the value of the borrowed shares. If a person “borrows” 10,000 shares that are currently trading for $100 per share, the interest if calculated on a value of $1,000,000.  This interest is paid by the short trader so long as his /her position is open. In other words, so long as he / she is in possession of the lended shares.

To lend the shares to the short trader, the broker “borrows” shares from his/her clients. That is you and me, and shares that we’ve actually purchased with our own money.  For example, if you currently own 1000 shares of AMC and do not have a sell limit order in place, your shares are available to be lended to short traders. And most likely, they have already been lended out given the current trading climate.

If this coming Monday you place a sell limit order on your 1000 shares at $100 per share, the broker would need to immediately return or replace your shares to make them available be sold by you. Typically, this would be accomplished by the broker borrowing shares from another client like me, for example. But if I already have a sell limit in place, my shares cannot be borrowed to replace your shares. In fact, if enough of the broker’s clients have their AMC stock tied up in sell limit orders at $100, the broker would then need to see if he/she can borrow the shares to replace your shares that have been lent from other brokerages.

If all of this is remindful of a legalized Ponzi scheme, that is because it is...a legalized Ponzi scheme.

If the other brokerages also have a supply deficit because of sell limit orders on AMC stock, the broker would have no other choice but to call back the shares from the short trader to replenish your position.

This is where the squeeze happens because at this point, the short trader needs to close out his / her position at market price or the broker will close it out for him / her.

As the share value of AMC climbs, the urgency with which brokerages will call back shares from short traders will increase exponentially.  

This is why every one of us needs to set sell limit orders on our AMC positions at $100 per share and up.  If we all continue to buy and hold and set sell limit orders, we will starve the brokerages of shares to lend out to short traders, and we will force the call back of all shares currently shorted.

Buy.

Hold.

Set sell limit order at $100.

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards.

1203,glg3153,t1_glg1utq,"Having an exit strategy, with every trade, is a not only fully legal, but also logically mandated trading policy where a person decides that, at some point, the stock has become over-valued. This usually involves setting a price-target, and basing the price target on the underlying fundamentals. The exit strategy should be communicated publicly among all investing group members in advance. For example, you might monitor the short position in a stock, and the fundamentals, set a price target, and watch sentiment. Once the shorts are squeezed out, and the price target is exceeded, with fundamentals indicating that what was once under-valued is now over-valued, at that point the investing group would shift from a policy of buy and hold to gradually reducing the position over time. Alternatively, you might seek to use the new position size in the company to alter company policy in a way that would create new value, which might make the stock under-valued, rather than over-valued. 

&#x200B;

DFV, as his name implies, is a value trader. He bought GME at $4, because he felt the stock was undervalued, based on the fundamentals. Would he would have initially bought this stock if it were at its present valuations, rather than $4 a share? At some point, the stock does become over-valued, and that is why every trader needs an exit strategy. That's why it is both prudent and ethical to begin talking about an exit-strategy now, which is exactly what every true value investor does with every trade. 

&#x200B;

Not only must the buy trade be driven by fundamentals, and by the assumption of under-valuation, but also the sell trade must be driven by fundamentals, and by the assumption of over-valuation. 

&#x200B;

Nor is a short squeeze ""Market-manipulation"". Short squeezes are 100% legal, to my knowledge. It is very, very common behavior for traders to trade based on not just value, but also sentiment. As Buffet says, be greedy when others are fearful. Combine sentiment-trading, driven by reverse-herd mentality, with value trading, based on fundamentals, and you have a winning strategy. It need not be short-term, but one should have an exit strategy. Buffet says his ideal trade is to buy and hold forever, but he very rarely does that. Usually, he buys under-valued stocks with negative sentiment, and sell over-valued stocks with irrationally exuberant sentiment.",-1,wallstreetbets,1612066553.0,1612065798.0
