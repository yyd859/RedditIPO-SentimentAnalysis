31,gleevla,t3_l8trdr,"CONCERNING RH, FIDELITY, VANGUARD, and $GME

Let's get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required. So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are... 🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. (I have also heard TDA is ok) You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail. This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

Basically, about 30% of GME shares are owned by just 3 investment firms (Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard). Another 30% is own by other investment firms and Ryan Cohen, which brings it to over 60%... all of who have a vested interest in seeing GME moon.

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON. Take this opportunity by the balls and never let go. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 USE YOUR 💎🙌

SOURCE: [https://fintel.io/so/us/gme.](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)

Check the institutional ownership of GME, If you think for one second that Blackrock, the world's largest investment fund, is going to let GME fail then you must be literally retarded.

They do not lose money. Period.

72,glegqzk,t1_gleg1rd,AMC short interest is tiny. Don’t buy the hype. This is a once in a lifetime event with gme. You find the limit by backing in to the approximate value at which the hedges funds can’t cover their short position and the negative value of the short is worth more than the fund. Assuming generally that must funds were following Melvin and that they set up position similarly the same. We know Melvin was down 30% at 140 so back of the envelope says 450ish. This is also the point at which the brokerages halted. They’ve done the math and have had the backroom convos. It’s somewhere around there. Remember your funds are insured. That means your stocks still need to be worth something to be recoverable. If you break the system this all goes to 0.

Currently the hedge funds are buying time. This will allow for either

#2 Broker a deal with Gamestop to issue more shares
#3 Change regulations/Laws in their favor

Time is of the essence.

The only way is to force their hand into covering positions with real stocks all at the same time. Exercising options over a long period of time allows them to repeatedly buy and sell and eventually cover their over subscribed position.
 Exercising call options will force them to purchase non-existent shares from the market squeezing them and potentially have the short hedge funds into playing the Hunger Games with each other.

You should be thinking in terms of outcome probability and uncertainty.

1) MOASS occurs, much tendies had, HFs  tears. Possible still, especially depending on how ITM calls shake out Monday-Tuesday, but the prolonged battle may prevent it from ever occurring.

Also, in analyzing data, often the best guess is weighting and averaging all the other analysis. So if the MOASS occurs, I believe that it likely will have some reasonable impact on the wider market — but I doubt the doom and gloom crash predictions. GME represents only 0.001% of the total market. And if that little bit crashes the over all market, there’s bigger problems than little ole WSB.

2) Government steps in: Fed, treasury, and SEC. This is beginning to look like the best option for all parties from a meta perspective. 

Likely gov offers to broker buying at $x.xx for each share, which will be smaller than MOASS, but still real money. The gov protects the market and their HG and MM buddies from taking the massive L/unlubed sodomy of the MOASS. Prevents lasting impacts to pensions, retirement funds, etc. Slap on some half-measure regulation around shorting, and likely retail investing, and call it a day.

Biden admin can’t afford to have major market ripples in the first 100 days, while trying to deal with COVID, along with the normal difficulty of an administration transition, and a wider economy in the shitter. Also, in a polarized political environment, it’s not the best look to leave retail holding the bag (see how well 2010 mid terms turned out) It seems a lot easier just to throw a couple Bs at the situation. I may be a smooth brained investor; but the one thing about government you can count on, is those in power want to keep their jobs. Fucking over the GME holders is the greater of two evils compared to making the HGs and MMs pay up (albeit lower amount), with maybe the gov softening the blow for the shorters on the backend.

3) MOASS doesn’t occur, it all goes tits up. In my non-professional opinion, this is impossible due to confirmation bias.

It actually doesn't pose that big of a risk to the overall market.

It'll take down a few hedge funds but you have to keep in mind, there are some very big investors (*Blackrock for one*) who are holding large positions in GME. 

Mostly likely, as the price goes up, they'll start drizzling out their shares to lock in some of the returns (*although if I was someone like Blackrock, I'd look at a competing fund with a million shorts & skyrocketing losses & bend them over the table to acquire their other assets at dirt cheap prices in exchange for giving them the shares to cover*).",12,wallstreetbets,1612038622.0,1612035482.0

If you feel that's what those shares are worth and someone is willing to pay that then, so be it. But also there will come a price where it costs more to pay these then the interest on the shares.

Depending on the tricks they pull and out actions, it may delay the skyrocket, but if we all hold, the skyrocket is literally inevitable.",2,wallstreetbets,1612040769.0,1612035482.0

282,glep9qk,t1_gleovsp,I hear you my brother.. one last question as a retard. What if half the community pussies out? Will it still jump regardless if a lot of the brothers jump off ship at these prices I see like 420.69 etc.. I know there’s a lot of 🦍 brothers on here that legit have 420.69 as their sell price and others at 5/6/7 up to 1k. Do you think if they jump off ship it can still shoot up? I mean I have faith it will still go higher and I love the idea that we’re fighting back and in theory it seems like even if half people sell it can still shoot crazy,1,wallstreetbets,1612040957.0,1612035482.0
283,gleq5jc,t1_glep9qk,"So if that happens, it will simply delay the rocket, and might bring the overall end price slightly down. 

As far as I know, there aren’t enough shares that can be paper handed to get the hedgies out from this. Many of the people who have larger positions, including some big whales, understand everything I’m telling you and won’t 🧻🤚. 

So yes, at $420.69, $500 and probably more so at $1,000 there will be plenty of selling that will slow this whole thing down a bit, but there simply isn’t enough to keep the rocket from blasting off at some point, to a higher height. It all comes down to watching volume and seeing how many do sell. 

If you want, you can go back through each day last week and see examples of this on a smaller scale. There were some big sell walls at $400 and $420.69 but it didn’t move enough shares, so we recovered quickly. 

Every day that goes buy, the more people are educated, the harder the 💎🤚 become, and the more resolve the community as a whole obtains.",2,wallstreetbets,1612041390.0,1612035482.0
284,gleqh75,t1_gleq5jc,Thank you my brother. Sometimes it’s hard to ask these questions without coming across super stupid but you’ve put my mind at ease a little. That being said do you think there’s a lot of whales on GME right now waiting for that jump and in your opinion how much longer do you think the hedgefunds will continue the game of cat and mouse?,1,wallstreetbets,1612041546.0,1612035482.0
285,glerpye,t1_gleqh75,"Of course man, happy to. I’ve learned all of this literally in the last two weeks. My screen time last week was probably 12-14 hours a day lmao. I’ve barely slept until last night/this morning. 
It’s not often I see someone where the amount of knowledge I have can pretty directly answer their questions, so I do so when I can. 

And that’s a good question. We’re not entirely sure. We really didn’t even know what whales were on our side until recently, and it’s possible more get involved. As we’ve learned this week about all whales and hedge funds, it’s nearly impossible to predict what they’re wanting/trying/going to do. 

I’m sure at least a good amount of the whales on our side are long, betting on the transition GME will be doing in the next few years. 

There might be some who see an opportunity to fuck up other/rival hedgies and approach this that way. 

I’m sure there are some who are just in for the rocket, but not all of them. 

That means in theory, that when those sell limits are reached at $420.69 and $1,000 and so on, there should be enough shares still 💎🤚 in some of these whales to keep the squeeze on track. 


Basically, I could believe that what the whales plan to do and what we plan to do possibly has the same ratio of strategies. IE, sell off points, holding, everything might occur at the same rate and time from them as it does from us. 

Those whales could fluctuate what the price and trend more drastically if say, they’re all planning on holding, or all planning on selling at $1,000, but I have no reason to believe they’re playing this too much differently than we are. 

Lastly, they’re much more intelligent than man of us, and the intelligent thing here is to 💎🤚 until the true squeeze. I don’t know why many of them would back down at a small peak when holding guarantees a higher one.",1,wallstreetbets,1612042144.0,1612035482.0
286,glesk4w,t1_glerpye,"Lool. I feel like there should be a way to post the thread for everyone that’s holding and unsure of how things are going to go. I’ve been trying to explain what you explained to me to certain people but it’s in very dumbed down terms. 

Dude, I’ve had to charge my phone 2/3 times a day myself, I’m scared to check my screen time cos I know it will look like a Fugayzi right now hahaha 

Man I would love to see this thing explode, all jokes and everything aside I put 80% of my portfolio in the big four and got burned on the two that weren’t really apart of the whole movement (bought at the top) so I was really hoping that GME could pull me out of a sticky situation but you’ve given me a lot more faith that it can

Well I’m rooting for us and the whales, the fact that you say competitors are possibly playing against the big boys makes it that much more interesting. NGL I thought it was secretly elon and Jeff having a laugh just to see how billionaires react under pressure. That would’ve been funny lol

I am poor, I have 1.08 stocks of GME and had to borrow a bit of money off my brother to achieve that. *(First thing no matter what, [even if I make $0 profit], is paying back my bro. I may have no money but I pay my damn debts come hell or high water)* I want to hold on to gme, but at one single share it just isn't enough to make a long term difference. Even if it got to 10k a share, that's not enough to make 1 share a lifechanging amount unless I liquidate and re-invest smartly. So, is it worth the risk to sell high, as I as high can in this short squeeze, and then buy back in during the following dip? Will there even be a dip? Any advice you can give would be appreciated.

I look at what's happening and I can tell this a major opportunity to make my life better depending on how I play it, but I am a new investor with zero know-how, and don't know what the best play is.",2,wallstreetbets,1612035901.0,1612035294.0
