""The amount required by clearinghouses to cover the settlement period of some securities rose tremendously this week. How much? To put it in perspective, this week alone, our clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements related to equities increased ten-fold. And that’s what led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of securities that the clearinghouses had raised their deposit requirements on. 
It was not because we wanted to stop people from buying these stocks. We did this because the required amount we had to deposit with the clearinghouse was so large—with individual volatile securities accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in deposit requirements—that we had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile securities to ensure we could comfortably meet our requirements.

Now that I have your attention, I've been a redditor for almost 10 years, rarely submitting posts or commenting, just mainly a lurker to read comments.

I stumbled upon some due diligence posts about GME over the past weekend, and decided to jump in on Monday at a price at $95. I still haven't sold, but with a stock price at $325, I could have easily tripled my money throughout the week and got out.

I mainly have followed the conservative investing subreddits, such as [r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/), [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/), [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/), which have suggested to invest in total stock market index funds, reduce fees, and enjoy my 7% return after inflation. After 6 years of this, things have been going ok, good, but not nutbusting exciting. I returned almost just as much from GME in this past week than from my entire 6 week working career. Granted, I know my GME earnings are fictitious, since I haven't sold yet and it can come crashing down (being a bagholder) at any point.

This whole week, I thought to myself, what sell target should I set? Since I consider myself a fairly conservative person, I would have been happy with doubling, or tripling my money and to not take part in this fiasco. After learning about infinity squeezes, I set my price target at $999.

After this past week transpired, I think here are some events that transpired that I think were the nails in the coffin for the hedge funds in wall street.

1. Viral spread of social media. EVERYONE is talking about GME. Everyone is going into WallStreetBets and taking a look. My boomer dad mentioned it to me last week, even before I heard about what was going on! Hedge funds have underestimated the power of virility of information through the internet and its exponential speed of growth. EVERYONE is buying stocks, all over the globe, from an already short supply of available stocks in the float.

2. Tweets from billionaires. Chamath Palihapitiya and Elon Musk, some of the most famous billionaries in the world!!!! Tweeted about GME. This is something that Wall street could have NEVER forecasted. This was the nail in the coffin for them, they never saw this type of exposure coming. Millions of people follow these billionaires, they are jumping in on the fun, and we have influential billionaires on our side.

3. Other hedge fund sharks coming in. Now that there is blood in the water, other hedge funds are joining in the party. They know what short squeezes are, they know how to put other funds in vulnerable positions and to play the odds. Not only do we have the power of [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and the people of the ENTIRE world, but we also have the power of other whales. The enemy of our enemies are really going to be the ones to push us past the finish line.

I thought to myself, Melvin capital and these hedge funds guys, they're smart. They'll figure out a way to weasel out of this situation and STILL make money some how. But with the 3 big factors above, these are things that they could have never seen coming, which makes me think they are utterly f\*cked.

Now for exit strategy price target. I currently have a $1,000 price target to would trigger, allowing me to break even, and then another sell limit order at $1,500, that would 15x my money. Bear in mind, I consider myself a conservative average joe, and want to get in and out QUICKLY. So here is another data point for you guys, for what a fairly conservative person is setting his price target at.

I know everyone here has crazy meme price targets of $69,420 etc., but this would just crash the entire economy. So I thought to myself, what would the max price target be without initiating government intervention? If the government gets involved, this could ruin the party for everybody. Can someone help me do the calculation, with a price target that would bankrupt only the hedge funds and market makers involved, and not the underlying banks that would initiate government intervation?

Thank you!

* Hold your positions
* Cover your entry fee but take no profits this year

* Smoothbrains:

89,glekifb,t3_l8u96r,"I ran some retardation through Excel. Correct me where I am wrong. Not FA, do your own DD.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1) most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @250+
2) covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3) if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4) this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5) conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion:
Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher. All paperhands, you are safe to hold, even if it dips all the way down to 1$, three times. Just hold.",5,wallstreetbets,1612038671.0,1612036858.0

It’s a fascinating situation. They have to let it play out with a semblance of honesty and that can’t happen because they created derivative positions that allows for a potential infinite growth of a small stock (vacuuming liquidity from around the market infinitely) if not enough people sell the stock. 

They may try to get all the institutional investors to sell their holdings but even then, if the price drops because of the fire sale, there still aren’t enough shares outstanding to cover the position and we’d all likely just snap up more shares at a discount and put them back in this situation in a week but with less leverage.

What they should do is just buy out the entire company at an above market-price, then they can sell enough shares to restore a price balance and prevent another squeeze on whatever options positions remain. 

Who should pay for that buyout? The investors of Melvin capital and any the other funds or brokerages that stand to be wiped out. Let them take out loans with interest from creditors to raise the cash or have their billionaire investors/owners put in their money.  Course they might have to sell some of their holdings, yachts and maybe their 4th through 32nd vacation homes but fuck em.

The fact you post this all over the place makes me think you're trying to convince people 822 is the top so they sell. I'd expect the next jump to be up to 800s based on the aforementioned self-similarity. It does no good to make people think the shorters have covered in the event the price goes 800+, its just the mathematical principals at play.
