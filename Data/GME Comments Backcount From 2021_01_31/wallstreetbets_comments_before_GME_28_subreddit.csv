Listen, I know its been posted many times here, but it seems like its being buried which is dangerous. They may attempt multiple small squeezes in conjunction with more short ladder attacks to get us to lose interest and throw our money into shill shit like silver over the coming week. Fucking silver? You kidding me? Here's the facts: Their interest rates are absolutely insane. They cannot hold this forever, and as soon as the people who get to recall those shorts think that the hedges are going to bankrupt, its getting recalled. But these people are arrogant. The lunatics DOUBLED DOWN ON THEIR SHORTS. The float is still well clear of 100%. As long as we hold, there is nothing they can do. IT JUST WILL MAKE THE FINAL RECKONING BIGGER IF THEY WAIT. So do not despair if it seems to fizzle Monday.

BUT MOST OF YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS. EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW. BOOMERS, TWITTER USERS, PEOPLE INVESTING FOR THE FIRST TIME, WHOEVER.

We  always talk about, how we are in a prisoner's dilemma wit holding the  shares. But this also works on those greedy shortsellers!

If  just one hedge fund with a large short position starts to cover every  position. The price will go to the moon! This forces every shortseller  to do the same (price now on the way to Mars, sorry elon we will be the  first). After this ""mother of all short squeezes"" we are ready to take  some tendies at around 4.206,90$. Now the hedge fund who covered first,  can short the stock at the top , to get back a part of the losses (so  they have a interest to cover early!). We become millionaires and \~80%  of the shortsellers get roasted. The only shortseller who gets off  lightly is the one who first starts to cover and initiate the short  squeeze.

While holding shares is  for free. Shortsellers actually pay around 33% borrow fee. It is much  easier for us to hold the stock! This gives even more pressure on some  big shortsellers to be the first covering every short position. AND,  lets not forget we care about each other, while the hedge funds would  always sell out their shortseller friends!

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

 **Fails–to–Deliver** — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.

Market makers have special exemptions from the rules: they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to twenty–one trading days before they have to borrow a share. When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy–in does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail–to–deliver (of the borrowed share).",5,wallstreetbets,1612047779.0,1612045043.0

The funds will have some value (of assets) they won’t go above say 5%. So I think another 5-10 billion is when you’d probably significant capitulation.

Look here. https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/ I mean really. Study this. Google this. Understand this. This is a fact. They are reporting reality. This is not someone’s opinion. This is data from the market (unless the market has false data!! lol but anyway). Now here’s what you will see. %short of GameStop is down. A lot. 13% daily. If that continues, and that’s a big IF btw, then under 20% of shares will be short by Wednesday.
So what about a gamma squeeze, is that still possible? Yea it is. It’s always possible, but let’s play it out for a moment. For a gamma squeeze to occur, we need something called a Margin Call. Google this term. A margin call is when a short is forced to buy back the stock because the value of said stock has surpassed the shorts liquidity. Thus, the short must buy the stock back or else the lender of the original stock would be placed at risk. Here’s where the gamma squeeze can happen. If a short is forced to buy back the stock, that can cause a big buy order. This then propels the stock price even higher, causing another short to margin call (also a great movie btw), which then propels the stock up even further, in a chain like reaction (similar to how nuclear bombs work!!). 
Ok great, so where does that leave us?
The stock reached a peak value of ~$469 Thursday. This means that, if a margin call chain reaction is to happen, it must be above the 469 point. Why? Because if it would happen for anything lower, it would have happened on Thursday! (Note, a margin call chain reaction for new shorts could indeed happen under $469, but given the declining %short this is thoroughly unlikely). Effectively, if we want a gamma squeeze the stock statistically has to be far and above $469, my speculation would be $800++ (could be wrong). Given the shrinking short position, the price point of a margin chain reaction goes up by the minute.
In all likelihood, the potential of a gamma squeeze has passed. Hedgies reorganized their risk. Thursday was the day, robinhood halted trading, and bummer, that window has gone. 
Where does that leave us? I have 725 shares. I bought out of speculation. I spent money I had earned from Bjtcojn. The real value of the stock given historical data is between 10-40 a share (speculation, but likely accurate). If I hold my stock I have ~0% chance of a gamma squeeze, nearly 100% chance of the stock reverting to its market value (within hours to months), but, there is still a chance the exuberance will drive the stock up.

I think you're referring to the ladder attacks they've been using to keep the stock price lower. In that case, Melvin and their friends have basically been trading a few shares back and forth between each other at a low price to make it look like that's what the stock is trading at. Think of the mechanics of that transaction though. Melvin's buddy owns a couple shares of GME. Melvin buys those shares from his buddy, so now Melvin owns those shares. Melvin then sells those shares back to his buddy.

But remember when they buy back the shares they shorted, those are actually shares that were loaned to them. So when they buy back a share, they don't actually own that share to trade back to their buddy. Instead they have to give that share back to the broker that lent them that share. So sure Melvin could probably buy a couple shares from his buddy at a low price, but in order for those shares to actually go towards closing out their short position, they actually have to return those shares to the broker. Melvin can't just trade it back to his buddy anymore. They have to find actual people willing to sell them more shares now.",1,wallstreetbets,1612052734.0,1612045043.0

To them money isn't something they have to worry about getting. Its a means of coercion to get you to work and to keep the Yacht or private jet they want out of your hands. Within their circle of insider trading and bailouts the stock market is just pretty much a way to give themselves free money without making it too obvious that is free to them.  
  
Essentially it is a system of slavery. If I have access to free money I get for nothing while you have to bus me at the restaurant you are effectively a slave to those who can just get themselves money. Therefore they need to be ""skilled traders"" who got their gains trading options or something. In reality its just a means to allocate money which does not make them skilled players but our masters, along with government spending which they control through bought politicians. And you can't take them down by costing them money.

DO NOT SELL AT 1k

they probably know that many are asking themselves if they should sell at 1k or not what the hedge funds might do it probably let the price go up to 1k and make another ladder attack to make it seem like the squeeze has happened, therefore making other people sell their positions.

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.
