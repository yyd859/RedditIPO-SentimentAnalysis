The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Also when GME hit $500 before it dropped quickly, there was definitely some people cashing out around that area that were there at the beginning.

GME 🚀 🚀 

Why do I think the squeeze will and must happen, and restrictions dropped:

The US stock market is currently worth $31 trillion at 1.8x the US GDP, $7 trillion of that is international money. If the SEC does side with the hedge funds and allow this corrupt system to continue, the entire world will witness this and lose faith. Resulting in the whole market tanking. 

The US government, treasury, FINRA, SEC and other parties really need to think big picture here, this isn't about GameStop, its about the rigged system coming to an end.

It may take them a while to find a solution so 💎 ✋. They must be on our side, there's no other way. 

Remember when you were a kid and bought a game or consol? Held on to it with dear life until you got it safe home? Hold those shares like you did that game/consol. This will come to an end soon.

So while signing up for Fidelity I noticed in the Terms they offer a Stock Loan Program.

TLDR: They will allow others to short your owned stocks and pay you part of the interest generated. They require 250k in the account it seems unfortunately, and IB seems to have a min of 50k. I couldn't find a min for WeBull and their page on it makes it sound like there isn't one. Just ""when it's on this is what happens"".

Normally this wouldn't amount to much for a single stock, but what with GME sitting at 97% short float and 250% short interest this makes for a prime opportunity.

Now imagine the following scenario:

An autist moves their holdings into one of these wonderfully opportunistic accounts and generously allow this hedgies the privilege to borrow their stocks to cover their shorts. Yet for this privilege they will have to pay them interest. Then when the contract is up they will have to borrow from someone else to pay them back. Rinse and Repeat.

So long as they are shorting all of this they are paying interest and as many others have pointed out, much of that is going to other hedgies that are silently riding this wave. They hold the majority of the stock...currently...and so they reap the benefit of the interest being generated on this crazy prices. Would sure be wonderful if the common individual owner was able to profit off this nearly never ending stream of revenue. Never ending so long as they can never get their short positions below 100% and completely close their positions. And it will only get better the more they short and raise the interest rate. So long as said autist above maintains his DeepFuckingValues and never sells they will never be able to use anything but loans to trade around and pay their shorts. Loans on loans on loan on loan on loans....each one with a drip of interest on the tip.

I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

big question is whether the short squeeze is over. consensus here seems to be that it isnt, consensus on CNBC etc. seems to be that it is. we have a vested interest in our answer being right and they have a vested interest in either theirs being right or us believing that theirs is right so ppl start selling before the potential peak

one area where we could all be mistaken is that while S3 etc are saying the short interest is still ~120%, i believe that’s actually just an estimate and we won’t actually know until mandatory disclosure on Feb 9th. if SI is still that high then my understanding is it’s pretty much guaranteed to keep squeezing and to go at least close to 1k, but if it’s under 100% then in theory we could have already hit the peak price? which *seems* unlikely bc there was a steady wall at $250 (yesterday i think?) but that could just be the result of all of us 🦍?

Each institutional position closing will be a chain reaction in a huge buying frenzy. If it does get that crazy, expect many institutions to go under. Funds, brokers, market makers, clearing firms. Stock market liquidation. 

Otherwise, maybe we just squeeze very little and we all end up like bag holding retards.

The shares are owned by ETFs, other hedge funds, and poors like us.  No one is really selling to drive the price down in order for those shorts to cover.  The hedge funds can short sell into the bid in order to drive the price down, but we like the stock and keep buying up all those dips.    

There comes a point where these heavily leveraged hedge fund companies will have to cover by buying shares to stop the bleeding.   If they shorted at $450, they may be willing to pay $650 just to get out of there.

506,glfvvu2,t1_glfesgi,"Sorry for the novel but here my take on stockonomics 101 wtf is happening 

Afew key things to understand right now as they apply to GME stocks: this will be long bear with me 

1.) a short is when a hedge fun borrows a share they don’t actually own, like a loan, so they can sell it. So lets say they borrowed a share at 300$ thinking the share would go down. This is called shorting. They then sell the borrowed stock at full price to you, and in a month when the stock is 100$ they get to buy the stock to give back to pay the loan off and pocket the 200$ difference. THATS A SHORT! They pay interest to the company to borrow the share while they hold it. If the shares go up they’re stuck and have to buy them back at an elevated price, this is called a short squeeze which is whats happening. 

2.) A naked short is when a company sells shares without even bothering to borrow them first. The hedge funds have done this also with GME and ended up over-leveraging (short selling way too much) because they were extra greedy. 

3.) Float is the number of shares available, ie they exist. When you see a short percent for a stock its usually under 50%, thats to say about half or less is borrowed and traded instead of paying for cash shares. Essentially its on loan. 

4.) These greedy bastards over leveraged to the point the stock’s short percent was 120%. Thats INSANELY high. savvy investors saw what was happening, they were essentially betting the company would go bankrupt while simultaneously pushing it into bankruptcy. This started back in 2018 and was watched on the wallstreetbets reddit. 

5.) When a short (a borrowed share) expires the person or hedge fund who borrowed it has to pay for it at whatever the market price is. Unfortunately for our greedy greedy hedgies, their options were set to start expiring and fast. Keep in mind every day they hold these borrowed shared they pay holding costs. Think of it as interest on the loan. 

6.) Some people got in early and bought cash shares in gamestop at ten, twenty, fifty bucks a share. Some got in later at 300 a share, as more and more people bought cash shares, the companies who lent them out started to say hey hedgies we need our shares back someone bought them. The hedgies went oh fuck, and realized they needed to get the price back down because if not they’d break even or gasp even lose money because remember they HAVE TO BUY AT THE PRICE WE SET. *sad face* lol

6.) Now for the drama! When this massive buy up of shares started happening it drove the share price up. This is us taking a “bullish” stance which means we think the stock will go up. The hedgies are in what we call a bearish stance, they thought the price would go down. They went uh oh and tried to trick people to panic sell their shares. They went on CNBC, they lied and said the short positions had been covered. They lamented that we had no idea what we were doing and that we’d lose our shirts. Some people who didn’t know better did panic sell at market dips (When the stock price drastically fell) and as they did we were there to buy up more shares. 150 a share, sure, 400 a share thanks, 250 wow its on sale, everyone who could just kept buying. Everyone who couldn’t buy just held what they had and as the days wore on less and less shares (Volume) were being traded. This told the math wizzards that be that the hedgies were running out of cheap shares to buy (Oh and every time they move shares they pay fees so the same 100 shares they could buy for 11,000 Tuesday cost them 33,000 on Thursday it just kept going up.) AND they’re still paying interest every day. They lost tens of billions of dollars in a matter of days. 

7.) Robinhood app among others touts itself as a trading app for the people. However, when they decided to block people from trading gamestop this past week they lifted a crazy revealing curtain: their revenue comes from the very clearing houses and hedgefunds they claim to rally against. They’ve been selling our trading information to these firms seconds ahead in real time so that they can adjust accordingly ie they’ve been stealing from us to benefit the hedgies. Our info is the product and they’ve used it to bleed the average retail investor over the years. They got slammed in the media and had to backpedal. They’re still limiting share buys. 

8.) International traders from almost every country joined in to hold the price of GME stock because they saw how fucked up this was. The apps still let the hedgies buy and sell but we could only sell. Thats illegal, but they probably figured they’d rather pay millions in fines than billions to us or go bankrupt. Tens of billions more lost Thursday, now they’re really panicking. 

9.) So we continue to hold our stock because we know we can stay here comfy we paid cash, and we can stay here longer than they can stay solvent. Melvin (A big hedgie) took such a loss they had to accept a very large cash infusion from even bigger hedgies. They’re all losing money like whoa.

10.) Robinhood and other apps reopen to trade GME and we pounce so hard that the jumps up in price are so big at this point its triggering freezes. One minute here, five minutes there, we keep buying and/or holding. We love this stock after all. They try ladder attacks again (artificially making moves to drop the appearance of the price to make people panic sell, at one point it went from over 400 a share to under 250 and still we held.

11.) Some other hedgies come in and buy out some of the short positions from their drowning friends; this time the daily interest on these borrowed shares is around 50% which is stupid fucking high because the share lenders cant hold this position forever. 

12.) Eventually we get our shares because the lender wont be able to leverage them anymore. As they have to return our shares they’re forced to pay for them at asking price. 300, 500 a share whatever, and every time they buy a share to give back, it triggers a chain reaction of the price going up, the fees going up, and the next set of shares costing them even more. This is called a gamma squeeze. As they buy it just rises, then they have to keep buying because it takes days to cover shorts at a level over 100%. Now they tried to lie again and say all the short positions had closed Tuesday then again Friday; we didn’t believe them because we aren’t idiots, and the few who did and panic sold didn’t even make a slight dent in their problem. Everyday less and less volume trades which means our stocks get stronger and more stable every day. This sucks for them big time. 

13.) Cue the whining and crying on CNBC. They say we are ruining their lives, that the idea of us claiming our fair share is bullshit that we are attacking he rich....poetic really. We closed (Ended the trading day) Friday above 320$ a share which was the next strike point (price) they were shorted at. This means that as of end of day Friday, the hedgies had to buy back, at market or more, every single share that they’d borrowed under 320😂 that hadn’t been covered yet. And as I mentioned before, every time they buy, our stock price goes up...and they have millions and millions of shares to buy back. BEAUTIFUL GAMMA SQUEEZE.

When a stock is shorted, they don't actually take the stock from somebody. A new share is artificially created and put into the market. The total supply of available stocks is artificially increased while they hold the shorts. In facts, it's so artificially increased that the market supply is twice as high as it should be if they short over 100% of the stock. 
What does that mean? That means the stock is valued at half of what it should be. In other words, if I were to go out and short something, the supply of shares available increases and the price falls.
A significant price drop can cause a panic and create even more loss. That is by it's definition market manipulation. That's how they are currently fighting us by introducing more shorts into the market to drive the price down further in hopes to scare us off 
And it's not working! WE ARE HOLDING! But it's market manipulation. And it needs to stop!

In facts, it's so artificially increased that the market supply is twice as high as it should be if they short over 100% of the stock. 
What does that mean? That means the stock is now valued at half of what it should. In other words, if I were to go out and short something, the supply of shares available increases and the price falls.
A significant price drop can cause a panic and create even more loss. That is by it's definition market manipulation. That's how they are currently fighting us by introducing more shorts into the market to drive the price down further in hopes to scare us off 
And it's not working! WE ARE HOLDING! But it's market manipulation. And it needs to stop!
 If shorting meant that they were borrowing real shares and charged interest for borrowing them, then that's fine. But if you create shares artificially out of thin air and sell them, then that's market manipulation.

First, plenty of people are going to be uninterested after GME. The amount of people squeezing who don't even understand what options *are* in the daily threads is astounding (not that it's a bad thing, but just an example of how much the GME growth here is solely hype based).
 
The moment GME is done, a massive exodus will happen. A shit load of people won't be able to handle how rough the OGs are to people asking to be spoon fed information that's easily researched and decide that it's not as fun as they thought. At least half of new users will fall into this group.
 
Then, you'll have the ones who *really* don't understand how risky options are. They'll see similar retardation in the usual threads over some piss poor DD, and learn just how much you can lose playing with options. I'll guess at least 10 juicy ""why do I owe 100k? I only sold a call. Covered? Wait whats covered? I thought I can just sell it? Wait there's a difference between buying and selling calls?"" threads.

I am very saddened that newbies and the media is referring to WSB as a ""Hedge Fund"", we are obviously not a hedge fund cause we never FUCKING HEDGE, hedging is not the way in WSB!! and if you are reading this asking yourself what a hedge is, you are about to go on a wild ride. 

Very very risky trading goes on here, and if you think risky trading is being down 20% on your portfolio you are in for a ride....

If you guys end up losing all your life savings on anything you read here, don't expect anyone to bail you out! We are not a bank catering to get bailed out. All you will get at best is an extra 75 dollars on your robinhood account if shit hits the fan and you use that platform.

1299,gleq3v2,t3_l8vm0b,"**Summary:** When you create an account and fund it with cash on Robinhood, it's automatically designated as a margin account, even if you're not using your traditional idea of margin. Again, this is NOT the margin they market to you to increase leverage in exchange for an annual interest rate.

The whole point of this is that when you're buying and selling shares, options, etc. you don't really own any of it outright. You're basically buying and selling IOUs to Robinhood who holds the actual equities and capital through their clearing house. You can verify this by downloading your account statement. It probably has every transaction's account type listed as Margin even if you never signed up for/enabled Margin. You have to call/email them to switch to a pure cash account.

What this means is that because you don't own any of what you see in your account, they have no obligation to share any profits for lending out your shares to other brokerages, hedge funds, etc. They're making tons of money off this and giving you no say in how your shares are handled unlike other brokers who give you the options to refuse to lend out your shares or share in the profits from doing so.

I highly suggest reading the entire thread because it explains in detail how shady the entire process is for each trade and how the volatility and perceived risk from an overwhelming bullish sentiment in GME, AMC, and other stocks broke their shitty risk management systems and showed how absurdly unprepared they were to handle this situation. They are desperately raising cash to avoid liquidation and if that happened we'd all be waiting months to recoup our losses. I am moving to Fidelity asap and highly suggest others do the same.

# Game Theory 101

Let's talk about the [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma). Two members from the same gang are arrested and imprisoned in separate cells. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair with a principal charge, but can still convict them with a lesser charge. The prosecutors offer each gang member a choice: betray the other and testify that the other committed the crime or cooperate with the other and remain silent. The outcomes are listed below:

- If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison
- If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison
- If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve three years in prison and B will be set free
- If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).

From an individual perspective, each gang member is incentivized to snitch on the other member. The silent option averages 2 years in prison while the snitch option only averages 1 year in prison. However, if both players choose the snitch option, the ""average"" result turns into 2 years in prison. The best outcome for both players is the silent option; by cooperating with each other, the ""average"" result becomes 1 year in prison.

# GME Theory 101

Translating the prisoner's dilemma to the current situation: the GME shareholders are the prisoners and the options are to hold or sell. If a shareholder decides to sell their shares and capture their gains, the stock price (and gains) will drop by a small margin for everyone else. Likewise, if all shareholders decide to sell their shares and capture their gains, the stock price will tank and most  shareholders will see a decrease in gains or even a loss. However, if all shareholders decide to hold, the stock value will rise and all shareholders will see increased gains.

1390,gletpom,t1_glero20,"First off, I know next to nothing about investments and this isn't advice. I do understand human nature though. 

Basically what is happening is that the hedge funds did way too many shorts, up to the point where hedge funds were borrowing stocks that other traders had already borrowed, like if you were to borrow money and then some other person borrowed that same money from you. It got to the point where more shares are owed that the number of shares that actually exist. 

Now if this were money then the Federal Reserve would just make that money printer go brrr, but shares don't work that way. Now all the hedge funds are fighting to grab an ever shrinking pile of shares, if they don't do it now then they could owe more later as the price keeps going up. Even if the brokers don't cash out now, they still owe money in interest and that goes up the longer they wait. In other words, if enough people hold on to the shares and refuse to sell, the price will never go down enough for the brokers to cut their loss, and the interest racks up at the same time.

At a certain point interest will become so high that the brokers will have to just eat the loss and pay whatever it takes to cover the shorted shares. If enough people own and hold GME, it is akin to pointing a gun at the princess and demanding a ransom from the king, he will pay whatever it takes as long as enough people in your gang refuse to back down.

Some people in this sub only have a small amount invested and don't seem like they even care to sell no matter what the cost is, they just want to stick it to the hedges.

To answer your question, yes it is absolutely a game of chicken, except the hedge funds are driving a Yugo and the retail day traders on Reddit are driving an M1 Abrams. The only way the hedge funds can win is to play a short ladder and trick people into thinking a mass sell off is happening by trading shares amongst each other to drive the price down, or if too many people get cold feet.",3,wallstreetbets,1612043109.0,1612040371.0

1394,glevjgi,t1_gleug1h,"The share price will drop if people sell. If the hedge funds cheat by selling the same volume of shares back and forth a few times, it can drop the price despite no real difference in the shares held. Hedge fund A sells a million shares to Hedge Fund B, and Hedge Fund B sells a million shares to Hedge Fund A at the same time. Everybody still has a million shares but the price just dropped. Obviously only hedge funds that are equally screwed by their shorts would collude in this way. 

Look at the chart yesterday and you will see a huge dip around 2pm, but instead of causing a chain reaction of sales, all the retail traders and brokers who are not hurt by short obligations decided to buy the dip and an enormous rally happened from 2:30 to closing. That is what happens when hardly anyone falls for the trick.

The hedge funds won't go belly up or anything, but it is a big middle finger to them and it will hurt their bottom line badly.

If I sold a hundred k shares one at a time and spaced them out a few seconds from each other, each one is worth a little less than the one before. Sell every single once at once and the price is locked in for all of them.

Also, they are not selling below the current market price to drive it down, the mere act of selling a large volume causes the price for the next transaction to drop.

1476,gleopwf,t3_l8vh8e,"Answer 1: the original shorts most likely were margin called and covered at significant losses, but the fact remains there’s still some ~57m short positions open which is 113% of float. This means the hedge funds have doubled down and reopened short positions, most likely in the $200-$300 range. 

Answer 2: The amount of actual float being traded is much less than the 550m weekly volume. GME is the number one most day traded stock right now so there is **a lot** of volume but very few shares **actually** being traded. Currently short sellers are paying high interest rates on their short positions and the margin requirements means they have to “lock up” their capital in GME instead of being able to trade in other stocks. It is now a war of attrition, and it costs nothing to hold GME. At some point hedge funds will face losses, either realized or the opportunity cost of not being able to use their money on winning trades.

If anything, the last week gave them time to cover some of their initial short position, initiate new shorts (as indicated by the amount of SI) and potentially hedge their bets by a few longs as well.

Anyone who thinks we are simply hurting them and they have no means of defending themselves is delusional. That is not to say that the hold is NOT affecting them. I think it's affecting them immensely, however they surely found ways of mitigating the damage as much as possible. I personally will hold my position because I believe in this company, not based on their current predicament but rather on the fact that they can capitalize on the current one-in-a-billion opportunity.

1585,glevidk,t1_glep3wk,"Oh absolutely agreed. I have a different point I was trying to uncover. 

And again this is speculation, theory, hypothesis not at all factual advice or sound knowledge. 

First off leave legalities and ethics out. Just the generalization is all I need. 

Let’s say you and I are at the park and we’re hungry. There’s a hotdog stand selling hotdogs for $1... we go we purchase hotdogs for $1. 
Now we take those hotdogs and stand directly next to each other also within view of the hotdog vendor. And between each other we start trading our hotdogs back and forth between each other for $2. 

People look and say wow retards! 
Don’t you know you can buy hotdogs for $1 over here. 
Yet when they look down now the price says $2 at the hotdog stand. 

Thusly, you and I have given incentive to hotdog stand guy to raise his price/hotdog.

Does it actually work? Can hotdog guy stay in business at $2.. of course he can as long as you and I are standing there trading back and forth for $2. 

So here’s my question why can’t you and I collectively agree that the hotdog was undervalued. And actively promote an upsale because we believe in the product. 

Furthermore, this is my real question. Why can’t we trade actively between each other, even if all we are doing is trading the same hotdog back and forth and the same $2 as well, to hold or elevate a price point. Again one we both believe is undervalued?",1,wallstreetbets,1612043982.0,1612040140.0

Important. 

Here’s what’s happening:

Usually a short squeeze happens over the course of a day or two. But this one is different. This has turned into a series of smaller short squeezes. They know most of us are expecting the traditional, obvious mega- squeeze, so the funds and other pricks are disguising their short covers - doing it slowly. They think the longer they do that, the lower our PT will be because we will begin to think the squeeze isn’t coming.

 But as the price is 🚀 they are also putting in new shorts (including new people doing the same). rationally, which we know nothing about, it’s a sound bet at this point, but we hold all the 🍌.

I get what you mean but the trouble is that making it private kinda goes against the ethos of what everyones trying to do here. It's not an elitist exclusive club that you need to get invited to, it's about transparently sharing good quality DD, extreme loss porn, degenerate gambling and, of course, shitposting and memes. We can't deprive the general public our top quality memes, that would be a travesty.

Plus making it private would basically say to all the boomers that we are engaging in market manipulation, and doing shady stuff that we don't want people to know about, which is obviously completely false.

The market is for everyone, from every background and every walk of life.

That of course doesn't mean we can't be degenerate gamblers who just want to make tendies, lets not forget what this sub is about, but please for the love of fucking god let's not become the snobby condescending fucks who have been looking down on retail traders for so many years and laugh at us on CNBC.",37,wallstreetbets,1612040335.0,1612040039.0
