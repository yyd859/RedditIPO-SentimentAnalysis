To do our sub loss; and if to live,

The fewer men, the greater share of tendy.

I pray thee, wish not one man more.

Rather proclaim it:

That he which hath no stomach to this fight,

Let him depart; his passport shall be made

And tendy for convoy put into his paper hand:

We would not die in that man's company

That fears his fellowship to die with us.

This day is called the feast of DeepFuckingValue.

He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,

Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,

And rouse him at the name of DFV

​

He that shall live this day, and see old age,

Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,

And say 'To-morrow is DeepFuckingValue:'

Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars

And say 'These wounds I had on DFV' day.'

​

This story shall the good man teach his son;

And DFV shall ne'er go by,

From this day to the ending of the world,

But we in it shall be remember'd;

They were skilled in arguing to get their way, but if you put the screws to them they could be caught in ""traps"" (e.g. Plato's questioning on ""what does it mean for a man to be brave?"").  Being called a sophist has taken on a bit of a double-edged meaning because of this.  It can mean you are a scholar and a teacher, or merely one that is skilled in elaborate/devious argument

#**Here's OP's post that got deleted:**


I am an actual GameStop employee, a store manager (can verify if needed). I bought in to GME in February last year when I started exploring the stock market a bit more heavily. It was just something cool to do and I only used money I wouldn’t miss (which isn’t much since I don’t exactly make a whole lot). I’ve been letting it sit ever since.

Over this last week or so, it’s been really surprising to see people actually rooting for us. We went from a store that had a loyal customer base to one that people want to shop at now that they 1) remember we exist or 2) just want to support the underdog. There have been so many times over the years I’ve worked here where my faith in the company wavered, and that’s not surprising given some of the really bad calls made over time. People were getting tired of us and our old ways and the changes were too little too late. Until now.

I have people coming in to chat who didn’t even intend to buy anything but doing so anyway. People calling telling me to buy GME and hold (I already am). People who actually want us to succeed. After years and years of negativity I’m honestly starting to feel just a little of the love, and hopefully it grows from here.

Thank you for all you guys do, and know you’ve got a few (actually probably a lot) of people on the inside rooting for you too.

Not sure of your company's policy, but as a store manager, I'm assuming you have access to sales data not available to the public.  You own stock in the publicly traded company you work for.  Aren't you subject to open stock trading windows?  These typically open and run a couple weeks after your company announces quarterly earnings.  I doubt you are currently in said window.  If this peaks, it might be illegal for you to sell your shares during the surge unless you're in an open window.

Be careful not to break the law - and publish incriminating evidence - to a forum most likely being monitored by the SEC.

1. Change the Company slogan and mission statement back to ""Power To Players""  We saved you now acknowledge this, embrace and use it as your platform and guiding principle for all decisions moving forward.
2. Immediately raise all employee wages to 15 dollars an hour or higher based on indexed standard of living costs in specific markets in the US.  Stop treating your employees like hot garbage and eliminate the managers who enabled this practice.  Your employees and their collective knowledge and social networks are your greatest asset going forward, if you choose to disregard it you may fail further down the line. 
3. Provide 100 percent company paid health and retirement benefits to all employees part time or full time.  Not shitty insurance either.  Actual fucking health insurance you can use. You could even start a employee stock program too.  We Like The Stock.
4. Stop all shady business practices and high pressure sales strategies.  Gamestop was lower then AIDS and Hepatitis in public opinion polling before this started, don't piss away the goodwill you garnered these past few weeks by doubling down on trying to buy my phone or selling me a used game when I think its new.
5.  Embrace Esports and streaming and integrate these platforms into your own at every possible level.  Sponsor local amateur and professional competitions to garner brand good will and establish new customers as they enter the market.
6. Support independent game development and begin to develop in house gaming intellectual properties and licenses.  There are great ideas that need a platform and this would enable Gamestop to compete with Steam and other online entities.

After the third time being fired, i told them to go fuck themselves. I fought termination and won, twice. I took pay cuts and demotions in the process. The final time, they tried to take my unemployment back, after waiting a full year for me to collect it.

As violence, censorship, and government corruption proliferate the globe, hatred and distrust for our fellow man continue to escalate. However, in the midst of everything going on since 2020, what started as a little sub here on Reddit (wsb) has not only showed the world what the little man can do when united with purpose, but this growing community (yes I know, and filled with all sorts of kinds of people#LOL) is proof that not all is lost! Wether you came here out of curiosity or to make money or to learn how to invest, it is of paramount importance to remember the power of community. We all have something to offer “the pack”. Reading through various posts the last couple weeks and watching so many awesome videos—I am in awe again. As easy as it is sometimes to just hate people or write them off over certain differences, the kind of comradery taking place here lately reminds me that even though we can be miles apart, gay, undecided, black, white  or purple, nothing is impossible when we put aside our differences and work together for a greater purpose.

am an actual GameStop employee, a store manager
(can verify if needed). I bought in to GME in February
last year when I started exploring the stock market a bit
more heavily. It was just something cool to do and I
only used money I wouldn't miss (which isn't much
since I don't exactly make a whole lot). I've been letting
it sit ever since.
Over this last week or so, it's been really surprising to
see people actually rooting for us. We went from a
store that had a loyal customer base to one that people
want to shop at now that they 1) remember we exist or
2) just want to support the underdog. There have been
so many times over the years I've worked here where
my faith in the company wavered, and that's not
surprising given some of the really bad calls made over
time. People were getting tired of us and our old ways
and the changes were too little too late. Until now.
I have people coming in to chat who didn't even intend
to buy anything but doing so anyway. People calling
telling me to buy GME and hold (I already am). People
who actually want us to succeed. After years and years
of negativity I'm honestly starting to feel just a little of
the love, and hopefully it grows from here.
Thank you for all you guys do, and know you've got a
few (actually probably a lot) of people on the inside
rooting for you too.
Edit: forgot this. FUCKING HOLD BROTHERS

Then when Cohen wrote ""the letter,"" the bet became a lot less risky and people jumped on board. Then it became a silly meme thing that was fun because we had songs and stuff.


But now? It's kind of gone beyond our control. It became a movement. Something for people to rally around. For sure, the #1 goal for everyone is to make a ton of money. And it didn't have to be GameStop, but that definitely helped. A lot of people were clearly feeling desperate because of 2020. And a lot of people remember how bad 2008 screwed them, so this feels like a chance to get back at those guys. And hey, I actually enjoy going to GameStop and looking around at the games. It reminds me of being a kid. And I don't want to see yet another company fail just because they couldn't compete with Amazon.

  At this point, after showing him how you guys helped me get on to palantir and AQMS,  I doubt he will  become involved in the community but he at least recognizes the  Value that this community provides and has asked me to keep him updated in the future.

1197,glepimj,t3_l8vqjo,AMC is still cheap-ish but caught up more in the lock ups. Nok and BB suffered more from selling after the gains but if you are willing to hold for some recovery they are still decent choices. Nok might be more long hold if you are thinking of sticking with the idea that 5G will pay off for them.,6,wallstreetbets,1612041078.0,1612040838.0

1203,glepoy1,t3_l8vqjo,"You should definitely consider researching $NOK. They are due to release their Q4 reports on Thursday (Feb 4th) and an investment Management company just upped their shares to now have ~6% overall shares. 

Contracts with NASA, contracts in the UK and potentially elsewhere in Europe as Huawei is slowly pushed out due to security concerns - the UK has already cancelled Huawei.

There are many more reasons but seriously consider it! Go join the $NOK page!",2,wallstreetbets,1612041164.0,1612040838.0

1213,glepjz5,t3_l8vqjo,NOK is a dog with fleas. And I say this as I have a soft spot for them cause I made good money when Microsoft bought their phone unit. And guess what their share price is exactly the same as it was in 2013 and I think they were working on 3G back then.
