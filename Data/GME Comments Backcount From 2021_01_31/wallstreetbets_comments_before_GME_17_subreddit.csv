Increased buying of silver – which we saw today – might actually force some folks on Wall Street to consider where they would find a place to buy and store more physical silver... If everyone buys some silver, the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) and Sprott Physical Silver Trust (PSLV) exchange-traded funds will be forced to go into the market and buy physical silver. Unlike stocks, physical silver supply is finite. The overwhelming demand will spike silver prices higher. The large banks use futures contracts and other derivatives to short the silver price. Right now, they are short hundreds of millions of silver ounces and stand to lose billions of dollars with every $1 rise in the price of silver.

Silver has been grossly shorted for decades now and the average share on the SLV has at least 250 paper claims for it. There have been serval examples of silver squeezes throughout history (see 2011 and the hunt brothers in 1980) so it's very plausible to happen again. I think the chances of a short squeeze in SLV is far better than BB, the numbers don't lie. But I don't care about any of these since our focus right now is and should be on GME but there's no harm in just speculation, like isn't that the whole point of this sub?",1,wallstreetbets,1612056181.0,1612053639.0

I say f them all so hard by buying all you can and let them bleed out cash out of thier ass.These short dont habe the balls to short companies overseas because they know they will get fucked. So they use the money they made in America to be against America and American workers.

How is this even legal?  They are doing literally trying to kill the American economy by making them go bankrupt by shorting thier stock. 

This to me is UN-AMERICAN. You fucking got an education in America, made your money in America and not fight to destroy  the American companies? 

I dont know about you guys, but I've bought and will be fucking buying all AMC, GME and BB I can and holding them until I either go down with the American company and triumph with the American company and American workers.

Betting against America has always been a losing bet and these shorts are beginning to find that out the hard way.
