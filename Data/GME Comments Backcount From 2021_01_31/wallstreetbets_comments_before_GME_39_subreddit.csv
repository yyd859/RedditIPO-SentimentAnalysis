The CEO of webull explained it very well, I suggest people check it out if they haven‚Äôt already, but long story short when you buy a stock the money you‚Äôre sending takes 2 days to process.  Clearing houses are responsible for the actual process and generally require 2-3% collateral, but given the volatility and the capital they had available they upped the requirement to 100% per SEC regulations, meaning every single GME buy had to be fronted for 2 full days, and given the volume they simply didn‚Äôt have the money.  We‚Äôre talking many billions of dollars needed instantly, and that just wasn‚Äôt possible.  They can still allow selling because they‚Äôre obviously not on the hook for any money, just the stock which they have. 

Honestly, as bad as the optics look, I think we can all agree that shutting down buying *and* selling just through certain brokers (remember, there were several brokers that restricted buying days before RH ever did) and not exchange-wide would have been 10x worse.

Are they just in the pockets of the HF‚Äôs they sell data to? Idk, maybe.  But I‚Äôm going with Occam‚Äôs Razor on this one.",1,wallstreetbets,1612075281.0,1612037662.0
