The CEO of webull explained it very well, I suggest people check it out if they haven’t already, but long story short when you buy a stock the money you’re sending takes 2 days to process.  Clearing houses are responsible for the actual process and generally require 2-3% collateral, but given the volatility and the capital they had available they upped the requirement to 100% per SEC regulations, meaning every single GME buy had to be fronted for 2 full days, and given the volume they simply didn’t have the money.  We’re talking many billions of dollars needed instantly, and that just wasn’t possible.  They can still allow selling because they’re obviously not on the hook for any money, just the stock which they have. 

Honestly, as bad as the optics look, I think we can all agree that shutting down buying *and* selling just through certain brokers (remember, there were several brokers that restricted buying days before RH ever did) and not exchange-wide would have been 10x worse.

Are they just in the pockets of the HF’s they sell data to? Idk, maybe.  But I’m going with Occam’s Razor on this one.",1,wallstreetbets,1612075281.0,1612037662.0
