It started with DFV showing us that gamestop was under valued and had real growth potential. Then when Ryan Cohen increased his stake that is when I bought in because I believed he could take Gamestop to the next level. The short squeeze was only a tiny voice at that time. Eventually the stock price got to a point where there was real talk about shorts not exiting their positions, and in fact doubling down.

This is not a short term investment opportunity. GME has a future to be a big player in a huge and growing industry. GME will be the go to e commerce for everything  gaming related. They will also grow into e-sports and gaming streaming. 

What’s more, their growth is coming out of the pockets of those who don’t own the company (the shorts) and flowing into the pockets of those who do own the company (the 🦍).

After the squeeze, GME will see a huge drop due to people cashing out, but you better believe when this happens, the shots are going to double down ever harder.

Once this happens, and IV drops, this is when you buy OTM call options that don’t expire for years. Why? Because GME does have good fundamentals. It is worth the price it is trading at. There is a future for the company. 💎🙌

107,gle854l,t3_l8snc3,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

287,gle87q2,t3_l8sn9v,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

Everyone, this sub is being infiltrated. This weekend is a battle ground. Not on the market, but in this community. There are shills amongst us. They will do anything they can to put the seeds of doubt in your mind. To make you scared. To convince you that you will be left holding the bag and that no one is really going to hold to the moon with you.

They will try appear as if they are on your side. They will use WSB jargon. They will sound level headed. Their comments will be bot upvoted and awarded. They are here to cause doubt and panic.

Do not let them win.

This is as much a psychological game as it is a numbers game. We have to have faith in eachother to HOLD. Call out the shills and cowards for what they are.

5K IS NOT A MEME

10K IS NOT A MEME

THIS CAN GO TO 50K OR ABOVE

THEY HAVE TO BUY ALL OF OUR SHARES AT SOME POINT TO COVER THEIR SHORTS. NOW IT IS A MATTER OF HOW LONG WILL YOU HOLD.

Have faith in each other.

This war may not be won quickly.

They may spend WEEKS causing a series of smaller short squeezes in the hopes you will panic sell once the price starts to drop on the tail.

DO NOT PANIC

IF THEY WANT THESE SHARES FROM ME THEY CAN HAVE THEM FOR 42,069 EACH

We are in this together. Let’s help keep each other aware of the power we have right now.

For those of you that can read you will see that the firm takes your shares and lends them out here is an example of the rates they charge for that service. https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME if you dont want them lending out your shares trade in cash not margin. This is how they make extra $$$$$ of you however it’s illegal for them to do this without your knowledge im sire it was buried in that disclosure you sign when opening your account. 💎🤲",1,wallstreetbets,1612035291.0,1612032627.0
