Curious to get your thoughts on DEEP ITM calls though. Holding a 4/16 25c and it’s been tempting to take the premium, but if we really squeezed then I imagine that premium would almost become infinite?

Congrats on scoring life changing gains on GME. So did I frankly speaking, thanks to your analysis published over the last couple of months (entered at 18 av). To be fair I hope DFV cashed out as well, he deserves it the most.

I'm looking to reinvest in GME when the dust settles. Noting the unstable situation what would be good price to get back in your view. Looking at $15-$20 personally albeit not sure if $25-$30 isn't the new bottom line noting everything that has happened (GME becoming one of the most traded stocks worldwide). I am fully aware this is speculative question at best as situation is too volatile. I'm not seeking for advice but open discussion.

You changed a lot of lives with your DD and you should be proud of what’s been accomplished.  I know my life has been changed, that’s for sure.  You and DFV and any of the other OG’s and Whales that gave everyone more confidence in this trade really are some of the smartest and humble traders I’ve interacted with.

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards. This is for all of us who sat at home and despaired at the fact that we knew the system was broken, wishing we could make a change. Well, we're doing it you stupid monkeys.

  And it’s fucking shadowbanned, or just not approved by the mods. Here it is.  

  “The sub is still under attack by bots/paid users/feds. Vet users before responding to them.

They are posting comments trying to “fit in”. Saying the words “we”, “us” and the like. They’re asking for financial advice, what to buy and when. They have little to no karma, if they do have some it’s from recent activity. They will keep engaging you, thanking you throughout the whole process. Account age varies, many are a year or more with wiped accounts. Some are brand new.  

  Check their account out!  They most likely have only posted in investment subs.

  I know there are many here who use alts, trying to separate their *business from pleasure*. I may do the same soon. This isn’t an attack on you. I’m sorry you do get included or even accused some times.  

  The users I’m referring to do not have good intentions. They want to catch you up, prove social media can “manipulate the market”, or get you involved in a pump and dump of some kind. Do not feed into their bullshit.  

  Could be the very billionaires losing money right now trying their hand at quick gains. Who the hell knows.  

  Mods are overwhelmed and have done a tremendous job with everything going on. We need to do what we can, have DD. Be a vigilante, protect your community. Point these users out, say “bad bot” and you may just summon u/b0tRank.  

  Just be careful everyone”.

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards. This is for all of us who sat at home and despaired at the fact that we knew the system was broken, wishing we could make a change. Well, we're doing it you stupid monkeys.

The thing is the people who have shorts basically have contracts to repay the stock in X time.  Brokers have contracts from the shorts to say they will get stock in X time.  As shareholders, we trust the brokers to give us stock.  If brokers cannot give us stock even though we bought the stock from them, they will go bankrupt.   


The whole GME stock/short doesn't make sense because there are more contracts for shorts than there are shares.  They just don't want the market to call them out on that.  Imagine if there are 100 apples and there is are 150 contracts for 1 apple each.  If someone got 101 of those contracts and asked for the apples, the broker realizes there are not enough apples and it is over.  Therefore, they (brokers/short traders) will try their best to hold 51+ of those contracts to avoid that situation.  That is causing the short squeeze because brokers (who made these invalid contracts) and short traders are trying their best to get these contracts.  However, holding these contracts cost a lot of money so they dont want to hold it forever as they cannot use the money.  Also, both the broker and short traders have to pay tons of money for holding these contracts (and fk them for making these invalid contracts in the first place)  


If they crash the market, the SEC would get involved and there would be a lot of consequences.  Sure, they can win with some super shady deal with GME/brokers but it is a last resort play.  Basically, they lost and closed the casino.",10,wallstreetbets,1612064002.0,1612063171.0

463,glg00hy,t3_l938ge,"They actually borrow the shares from brokers. Almost every broker around the world has a provison in their contracts with traders (their clients), which gives the brokers the competence to lend out securities that are owned by their clients, which those brokers hold for their clients. 

However, those same provisions usually also give the client a legal claim on re-delivery of the seceruties that were lend out. In other words: they have to give 'm back to the client that is legally the owner of the security.

Here's the juice: many national law systems put obligations on brokers to keep a margin, to secure any claim for re-delivery from clients. In europe, 100% of the  value of the securities that are lend out by the brokers, which are actually owned by their clients, needs to be secured by either cash or some other securities.

Hence: at the end of the day, those brokers need the securities back, or they breach their contracts with their clients, which triggers their liability. Also, due to the current situation and the fast rising price of GME, the brokers who lended out GME shares of their customers, need to increase their margin. 

So yeah, brokers are definitly in a shitty position if the shorters cant deliver.

But besides all this legal mumbo jumbo, there's just one strategy: HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS!!!

Op's theory suggests brokers will be willing to essentially forgive this debt, which seems very unlikely, even more unlikely they would settle on a direct cash amount as the debt isn't cash but the literal share.

Personally what I think will happens is 1 of 2 scenarios, regulators halt the creation and sale of new puts on GME and allow limited calls, this could instantly (in theory) set off the short squeeze at market open as the calls get driven up and MM are forced to hedge.

A likely alternative is this stand off continues until there's an event that causes the public to lose confidence in the market. The resulting sell off of all shares would trigger a margin call setting off the squeeze.",1,wallstreetbets,1612066513.0,1612063171.0

594,glg3p8i,t1_glg21hm,"The main issue is for an infinite short squeeze, we will need to jack the price of these contracts up.  They are artificially keeping it down by limiting buying power.  So pretend we got the 101 contracts  but the hedge funds are trading the other 49 contracts at $100 among each other, making the market price $100.  Then we dont trigger the short squeeze.  But if we grab the contracts they are artificially trading at $100 and start a wall at $500, the price/interest of the short contract is now $500 which would bankrupt some hedge funds.  

If people just keep holding this forever, I do believe GME will issue new stock at some point to rescue the hedge funds that are stuck with these impossible short contracts.  However, they shouldnt do this right now and they cant issue enough to rescue all the short contract holders.    


If people are irrational enough, the stock of GME will artificially stay higher than it is probably worth. But people who just buy and don't sell are basically taking the shares out of circulation and you can think of them as shares that don't exist.  So like instead of 100 apples and 150 contracts, there are only 50 apples and 100 contracts.  It applies pressure to the system as long as there are more contracts to apples.

639,glg3jhz,t1_glfy2oh,"You are assuming share price is static and there’s no such thing as time.

Your logic is let’s hold all the currency hostage so that demand skyrockets... that works to a point, but doesn’t solve the liquidity problem.

Eventually lender and Borrower want to move on so they just settle up with a different currency.",-1,wallstreetbets,1612066841.0,1612063171.0
640,glfz8pg,t1_glfyh2e,"Ya, makes 100% sense, I only put a few grand into this and it’s all money I’m down to lose. My portfolio remains spread according to the stocks I believe in. All risk levels I’m willing to accept. Only amounts to ~$75k anyway. I appreciate all I read on here. So much crazy things happening to people and the stories are so entertaining. DFV’s story is the stuff dreams are made of!",2,wallstreetbets,1612064479.0,1612063171.0

642,glg0hhq,t1_glfz8pg,"I feel you.  Just don't lose sight of the fact that DFV got into position down in one of the sub-basements. Whatever floor were on now, and however high this elevator eventually goes, his story isn't the story we're going to have.",2,wallstreetbets,1612065141.0,1612063171.0
