Here is a great article that is now required reading for all crayon-munchers playing this stupid game. It provides a detailed, comprehensible breakdown 
of what happened last week and what to expect. I'm just a dude thats been in the market for a few years but everything I've learned along the way tells me that THIS IS NOT A SCAM, THIS IS WAR. And thanks for all the awards! Your money is better spent on $GME though...

Highlights for all those that I know won't click it:

>The whole GameStop saga is one of the most fascinating things to ever happen on Wall Street.

>If the infinity squeeze had unfolded — and it was oh, so close — various Wall Street entities, including not just hedge funds but brokers and banks, could have been forced to eat more than **$60 billion** in losses.

>...they have done the math, and the math says the Reddit army can win. Especially as they probably have professional firepower on their side, too (in the form of hedge fund managers and individual traders who are betting on the success of the squeeze).

>...But we know the squeezers came very, very close — and are still trying — and Robinhood panicked, and then rounded up a billion dollars in emergency funds.

>The events of Thursday, Jan. 28 are related because it was the near-completion of the Infinity Squeeze that scared the daylights out of Robinhood; and it was the buy restrictions set in place by Robinhood (and Interactive Brokers, among others) that prevented the Infinity Squeeze from happening. Temporarily at least. ***It may yet come to pass.***

DO NOT BAIL OUT THE HEDGE FUCKS

Do not destroy your citizens’, 🦍 🦍 🦍 and the world’s faith in your integrity and the integrity of the stock market.

If you HAVE TO do SOMETHING then fucking:

- Halt GME
- Announce buying EVERY SINGLE SHARE for $10,000. #realstimulus 🚀🚀🚀
- Go after Melvin, Capital, Robinhood, etc... for this bullshit
- set examples of above chucklefucks 
- profit???

You would simultaneously initiate the largest organic growth explosion in our economy. Transferring that much wealth to the little man will increase:

- more stock purchases across the board (likely to be held as actual investments)
- house purchases
- yachts for my wife’s boyfriend
- double cheeseburgers with Mac sauce
- tendies 

Whatever drives the American economy I don’t fucking know I’m not a financial advisor. 

Do NOT fuck up the retail investor. If you have to, HAVE TO in order to save your own ass, bail us out for catching the bad guy.

This statement is critical, and I think is going to be the narrative come Monday. No more glib ""live by the sword, die by the sword"" comments, but more OMG the entire finncial system could implode as these dominoes start falling.

 CNBC already started this rhetoric when  SPY dropped - they were saying the hedgies had to liquidate other positions to cover the GME short losses, CNBC kept harping that AAPL had crushed earnings but its price dropped. They got pushback from actual informed peoople that the drop was a normal result of buy the rumor, sell the news, but CNBC bobbleheads didn't like that answer.

The only way you can short over 100% is to loan out the same individual stock multiple times, right? So it seems logical the only way to cover over 100% is by giving back the same individual stock multiple times?

If I made a logical error somewhere, please correct me. But it seems to me, as long as some people are willing to sell multiple times, the hedge funds won't need your specific bundle of stocks at any price.",2,wallstreetbets,1612094046.0,1612064427.0

You can buy the stock at the strike price if you want to (but you should only if it's above so you can sell on the market.) But since you won't be able to take delivery, you'll need to sell the option instead before it expires.

When you buy an option: market makers buy the stock to hedge (so they remain neutral if stock goes up.)

By buying options, you're forcing other people to buy stock.

A spread is when you buy a call and sell another call at the same time with different strike prices or dates.

I entered AMC trade for free on Wednesday, hoping to replicate it on Monday.  Might be able to do the same with GME, but eh capital requirements heh.

If you buy a lower strike call for less than the amount you sell a higher strike call for on the same expiration date, you cannot lose. (And that's what happened to me.)

Unlikely but possible: the rules get changed mid game and we all go to jail for beating them.

Bottom line: hedge funds have sold more shares than they have access to. Who they sold them to, I have no idea (someone help). But the value of the shares will increase until people are willing to sell.

Since hedge funds were mean to us  (2008) we won’t sell for any amount until they make it right and we are allowed to play in the casino as equals.

Or: GameStop goes under and the shares lose value because they aren’t backed by anything

They are both still over 100% short (120% is at best estimates) and they are short shares. It's 2 factors that NEVER happen together and make this situation so unique. They are on a time crunch where they are losing money on short interest, but they need to come up with millions of shares to return to borrowers and that volume is LOW.

Once the 'bandwagon' subgroup begins to fold (Sell) its all over.  the house of cards falls down (as well as the price).

Either way I'm sure it will be quite the show on monday.  I'm ready to behold the spectacle!   If anything it's been thoroughly entertaining.

Plus a lot of this also depends on how many sell.  Get enough people selling and they see their friends selling and sell.. and it cascades until enough shares open that brings down the share price.  

If the prices stabilize in the 300-400 dollar range for too long (or even retract back in the upper 200s), I think people will grow tired of waiting, close their positions and go back to whatever they were doing in their lives (that wasn't trading).",5,wallstreetbets,1612066128.0,1612064427.0

750,glg4to7,t1_glg2t9g,"Most people who pull before a market correction get pummeled. 

There’s three scenarios, with the first two being far more likely. 

1. You were wrong, the market doesn’t crash. You sold and waited for a dip, but that dip never came. A month, or months later, you give up the game and repurchase at a higher price point than you sold. 

2. You were right, the market crashed. You wait until the trough to buy. Like in every crash, the buying window opens and closes relatively quickly. You miss the opportunity to buy and are forced to re enter at a higher price point. 

3. You were right, the market crashed. Unlike 90% of your peers, you knew exactly what day and price would be the trough, you pile in and make fat stacks. Your wife leaves her boyfriend, allows you to fuck her. McDonald’s is offering free tendies at the drive through. An aunt you never knew you had dies and leaves you with a billion dollars in the will. Twas a good week. 

Your best bet would to be dollar cost averaging on the way down, adding to your portfolio instead of pulling out.
