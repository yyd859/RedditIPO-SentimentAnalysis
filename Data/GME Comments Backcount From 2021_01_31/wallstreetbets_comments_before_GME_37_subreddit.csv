22,glema9f,t3_l8v6q0,"I ran some retardation through Excel. Correct me where I am wrong. Not FA, do your own DD.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1) most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @250+
2) covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3) if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4) this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5) conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion:
Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher.

For those concerned about losses on a hard crash.... Best comment I saw on here was, make sure you cover your base cost on the way up. If you‚Äôre in GME certain apes might consider selling JUST ENOUGH on the way up to cover their initial cost so that all you have to lose is profit. That way whoever is caught holding the bag at the top only has profits to lose. No life changing losses if all you lose is profit. Also, with those profits set limit sells at like 10% of what the price is at. This way you don‚Äôt cause a sell off with your stops but you also don‚Äôt lose every bit of profit if it comes crashing down. Do this and your ass is covered, you‚Äôve locked in profit, and you‚Äôve stuck it to the man. Rinse and repeat for AMC after the dust settles. 

Except this time the movement has even more buying power for AMC allowing the squeeze to happen even easier. BUT, if this movement as a whole is divided into different stonks right now, the resources are spread thin making this first GME squeeze harder to accomplish. 

TLDR: GME first, AMC next. Be smart, cover your ass. Apes together strong.

I actually think this is a flawed take. 

The people buying AMC et al are doing it because a) they literally weren't able to buy GME on Thursday when they tried. A lot of people didnt have backup investing accounts or, like me, didn't realize they did (Roth IRA I don't think about for 11.5 months out of the year). 

Or b) can't afford the prices GME is trading at - too late to the game, but still want to feel involved. Not everyone is on a platform that allows fractional shares. If all you have is $200, you're shit out of luck at this point. GME isn't an option. But cheaper stock is. 

I think you're talking about two different audiences with only a relatively small overlap. You could sacrifice 100% of AMC and still not gain any noticeable increase in GME buying. 

The other issue you're overlooking is that a lot of people overpaid for AMC. If they sell everything first thing Monday for $13 or 14/share to focus on exclusively on fractional GME shares, they could very well end up with - $2-7 per share, depending on when they bought.",0,wallstreetbets,1612040173.0,1612039307.0

I obviously get the reasoning behind the GME focus, but frankly I think as long as wsb holds we‚Äôve done about all we can do. Where it goes from here will depend on the extent to which whales get and stay involved on the buy side. We can, and should, still be talking about bb and amc, and other stocks, too.

Edit: by the mix of upvotes and downvotes, I‚Äôm beginning to worry about a new threat here. While some like me will worry about gatekeeping re. GME in this sub, others will see anything not all-in on GME as HFs trying to infiltrate us. There‚Äôs going to be risk of division here.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1) most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @250+
2) covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3) if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4) this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5) conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion:
Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher.

I've been seeing a narrative growing that our diamond hands were responsible for nearly breaking the market on Wednesday before they restricted buying.   


Lets keep something clear. The ones who nearly broke the market was Melvin and other HF who have no idea what good risk management is,  doubling and tripling down on their short positions.  


The free market should guarantee that these poorly managed companies go out of business and their funds go to the winners (us). If there is a capital issue that needs government bail-outs it should be us who get the bail-out not them.  


Don't be scared when they talk about crashing the economy. Demand the government let the HF fail and bail-out the investors, (us). Fight back against any potential bail out and keep highlighting the fact that the HF shorted over 140% of the stock.

Usually a short squeeze happens over the course of a day or two. But this one is different. This has turned into a series of smaller short squeezes. They know most of us are expecting the traditional, obvious mega- squeeze, so the funds and other pricks are disguising their short covers - doing it slowly. They think the longer they do that, the lower our PT will be because we will begin to think the squeeze isn‚Äôt coming.

 But as the price is üöÄ they are also putting in new shorts (including new people doing the same). rationally, which we know nothing about, it‚Äôs a sound bet at this point, but we hold all the üçå.

If you are being real about this statement - earnings in Q4 has to outmatch expectations like 10x at least to just match the growth of GME (I don't know shit how to evaluate this number). 

In other words, I dont believe earnings matter enough to make a change. Other examples of ""fundamentals"" dying right now - on BB stock like day or two ago some boomer-analyst published downgrade on the stock - on that day BB went up 60%.

342,glemfsk,t3_l8v1we,"I ran some retardation through Excel. Correct me where I am wrong. Not FA, do your own DD.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1) most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @250+
2) covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3) if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4) this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5) conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion:
Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher.

Everyone, this sub is being infiltrated. This weekend is a battle ground. Not on the market, but in this community. There are shills amongst us. They will do anything they can to put the seeds of doubt in your mind. To make you scared. To convince you that you will be left holding the bag and that no one is really going to hold to the moon with you.

They will try appear as if they are on your side. They will use WSB jargon. They will sound level headed. Their comments will be bot upvoted and awarded. They are here to cause doubt and panic.

Do not let them win.

This is as much a psychological game as it is a numbers game. We have to have faith in eachother to HOLD. Call out the shills and cowards for what they are.

5K IS NOT A MEME

10K IS NOT A MEME

THIS CAN GO TO 50K OR ABOVE

THEY HAVE TO BUY ALL OF OUR SHARES AT SOME POINT TO COVER THEIR SHORTS. NOW IT IS A MATTER OF HOW LONG WILL YOU HOLD.

Have faith in each other.

This war may not be won quickly.

They may spend WEEKS causing a series of smaller short squeezes in the hopes you will panic sell once the price starts to drop on the tail.

DO NOT PANIC

IF THEY WANT THESE SHARES FROM ME THEY CAN HAVE THEM FOR 42,069 EACH

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1) most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @250+
2) covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3) if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4) this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5) conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion:
Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher.

569,glf37dw,t1_glekzw8,"I keep seeing your posts all over the place called $822 the top. Covering shorts is not linear, it's fractal, as all squeezes are self-similar. In other words, exponential growth is expected, and your argument doesn't make sense.

The fact you post this all over the place makes me think you're trying to convince people 822 is the top so they sell. I'd expect the next jump to be up to 800s based on the aforementioned self-similarity. It does no good to make people think the shorters have covered in the event the price goes 800+, its just the mathematical principals at play. But you probably know that and are trying to get people to sell earlier...

**Quit pretending like you know the future or can call the top. No one can.**
