The short ratio of GME is still very high.  It takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover. 

I come from Hong Kong, and I stand with all WSB people. 

For those people who are fear. Listen! If the short ratio of one stock is talking about ~100%, we must win provided that all retail investors buy and hold. This is simple mathematics. If you give up and sell your stock now, we lose and the hedge fund wins. Don’t waste the previous effort of bruh here. Strong buy and strong hold.

Please note that it takes at least days or weeks for hedge fund to buy cover the stock. No fear. Bruh! Disregard what the mainstream media and BS said, and simply buy and strong hold GME. YOLO! Keep chasing our dream. Bring GME to moon or even Mars.

If your broker limits buying GME, please don’t give up and try buying from Sofi and Tradestation. You may contact your account manager of Tradestation for help if you have difficulties of buying GME.

I love you all. Love from Hong Kong.
