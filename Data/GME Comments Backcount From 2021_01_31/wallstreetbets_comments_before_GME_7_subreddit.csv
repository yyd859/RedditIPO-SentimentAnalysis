161,glfw8vq,t3_l934r4,"Everyone, this sub is being infiltrated. This weekend is a battle ground. Not on the market, but in this community. There are shills amongst us. They will do anything they can to put the seeds of doubt in your mind. To make you scared. To convince you that you will be left holding the bag and that no one is really going to hold to the moon with you.

They will try appear as if they are on your side. They will use WSB jargon. They will sound level headed. Their comments will be bot upvoted and awarded. They are here to cause doubt and panic.

Do not let them win.

This is as much a psychological game as it is a numbers game. We have to have faith in eachother to HOLD. Call out the shills and cowards for what they are.

5K IS NOT A MEME

10K IS NOT A MEME

THIS CAN GO TO 50K OR ABOVE

THEY HAVE TO BUY ALL OF OUR SHARES AT SOME POINT TO COVER THEIR SHORTS. NOW IT IS A MATTER OF HOW LONG WILL YOU HOLD.

Have faith in each other.

This war may not be won quickly.

They may spend WEEKS causing a series of smaller short squeezes in the hopes you will panic sell once the price starts to drop on the tail.

DO NOT PANIC

IF THEY WANT THESE SHARES FROM ME THEY CAN HAVE THEM FOR 42,069 EACH

We are in this together. Let’s help keep each other aware of the power we have right now.

Please help spread the word.

How does Robinhood survive this? Maybe pay us in $GME?

Robinhood (RH) is getting the most credit for locking out users from participating in the free market this week.

Do they deserve more credit than others? Probably not. Is it fair? Probably not. There are explanations coming out that are plausible, particularly from[ u/only-tells-the-truth](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7fw0x/i_used_to_work_merrill_heres_what_likely_happened/). If you read the play by play from[ u/jn\_ku](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/), it seems that RH's decision to lock us out was in sync with a coordinated decline (SEC, this is market manipulation) of the $GME stock price.

What's not clear is; if RH was just an innocent bystander in all of this and the clearing house was like 'stop selling or else', then WTF didn't they just say that? Why did we get BS about the volatility of the market and whatever, while traders on Fidelity and shorts were lapping up the discounted stock? If I were heading up RH, and any of the clearing house BS were true, I would've been on Youtube that day with a friggin white board illustrating how my business worked and how I was forced to fuck you like the pig on black mirror and here's the name and number of the clearing house douche bag that said to cut off the water.

What they did instead was give interviews about how they needed to protect whatever, like they did some noble act.

I don't understand, but I'm retarded and eat crayons so maybe it's just me. It sounds like they knew if they continued allowing us to buy stonks they MIGHT get fucked. How did they not know that if they locked us out that they were DEFINITELY fucked? There isn't a RH user on here that hasn't googled 'how to switch brokerages' in the past two days. RH's business model is to kind of fuck us by selling our trades to whoever so they can make them first. They have to pick up the phone when Citadel calls, but Citadel is only daddy if they have our data to sell. WTF were they thinking?

So, how does RH keep any of us? The only way I will stay RH is if they do the whiteboard Youtube video. Completely explain how all of the shit works so apes can see; you take orders, you push to clearing house, you pay 3% collateral on this, and you collect fees on everything you do, whatever. Open trading on all stonks and calls. Then, RH should give five shares of GME to every user.

If they do that, I'll stay, otherwise I'm out.

Bonus: if in addition to the above they post video of Vlad peeing while seated, I'll not only stay with RH, I'll keep gold after the trial ends.",19,wallstreetbets,1612063610.0,1612062509.0

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards. This is for all of us who sat at home and despaired at the fact that we knew the system was broken, wishing we could make a change. Well, we're doing it you stupid monkeys.

If I'm understanding this chart correctly, Financhill shows that GME has been shorted to an insane level and that it's all poised to implode in about 6 days.  
[https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)

But it also shows AMC shorted somewhere around 35% of the stock in play (if I'm understanding the term ""float"" correctly) with only 1 day left before SHTF (to a far lesser degree than GME). 

Reading through WSB, the general consensus seems to be something along the lines of ""Buy GME now 🚀 and once it's in orbit then go buy some AMC (and NOK, BB, etc), then give your wife's boyfriend a handjob behind the dumpster at Wendy's. ✊🍆🍔🥫""

So, won't AMC already be 5 days past it's squeeze-point by the time GME begins it's moon-launch?

AMC is only shorted 40% which means we would have a LOT more shares to buy and hold to force a squeeze there if that were the objective.  The reason VW was squoze was because during the runup Porche revealed they were in possession of 74% when shorters thought they only had 40 something % of the shares available and that caused the shorts to panic and sell what they could before others could in a mass exit since they knew Porche would hold as they were trying to acquire VW.

We will give you GME, but you’re missing the biggest play. (Older smarter/better you)

Your missing the deepest play (an older/better) version of you sees it!!!

I’m not going to say I would have found your guys idea on the short squeeze, I’ll give you that.  But now that I’ve been following it since I purchased some shares to support you idiots at $75 (and I did sell most!) I have now seen the biggest play.  

I will give you guys until Wednesday night to figure it out.  Your play right now is gold, don’t get me wrong, but there is one that is 1000x.

My justification- I know it’s you  some of you guys were maybe hard core enough to get into wow, I’m guessing most of you are just gamers who hopped from game to game like sheep.  I also know you and the foreigners hold all the Tesla stock and don’t want to sell out of loyalty, even though a lot of you are to support the cause. I respect it, that’s why I’m posting.


I come from a different crowd, the type that wouldn’t go to the first castle in final fantasy tactics until I hit lvl 99. That’s 80 hours of gameplay before beating the 3rd map.

My friends and I would stay up all night to lvl once in FFXI. Some times stay up all looking searching for a party, waiting by a boat for 30 minutes to get somewhere else (no instant travel) then running on foot disguising ourselves with potions for an hour just to get to the spot for some XP.  Someone would disconnect and the night was over.  We did this all secretly while winning the sports in high school.  What, did you think none of us were secret hardcore nerds? But that’s why I know the ultimate play and you do not.
I can only speak in gaming terms to you because  nothing else could be measured from our time, it doesn’t mean you have to be a gamer.

The Real Reason the Market will Crash

	It is currently June 9th, 2020 during the George Floyd Movement and Covid: 19.  The stock market took a big hit back in February from Covid, but it has been steadily on the rise ever since.  Although, it has dipped a few points in the past couple of days…
	This has been incredibly confusing for me, luckily today, I have figured it out.  I have not yet figured out the solution, I hope to find it by the time I am done writing this.   Why was I confused?  Well a large part of our work force just kind of quit working around March, they were “adjusting” to working from home and most people did just not have much to do.  Another 20% or so of our workforce got laid off, were fired, or something of that nature.  Our cities were shut down collecting very little money, everyone was quarantined while our hospitals were overrun with people dying and getting treated.  Large old corporations and retailers are shutting down left and right.  Robots are taking over our jobs, and we buy everything from the country we are about to have an economical war with (at best).
……Then some white police officers decided to execute an unarmed black man in broad day light on camera.  This was enough for our country to have a much-needed revolution.   During this much needed revolution, people protested (shutting down our cities again), and then various groups across the country burned down buildings, looted, and caused chaos.  Oh, and everyone just pretended Covid never happened and gathered in our countries most populous cities for about 80 hours screaming spit at each other and holding hands……

If you read earlier and I explained why I am confused as to why the stock market keeps going up and you aren’t a little bit curious as to where I am going with this, then you should quit reading now.  If you keep reading, I am happy to reassure that you will not have to struggle for 2 months like me, you just have to keep on reading.  I still haven’t thought of a solution and getting less confident the more I write.

	So, why is the stock market still going up and has been while all of this is going on?  Well I believe that Covid happened and classes that typically weren’t investing, started to invest online.  I can’t find the data online, but I’d be willing to be that new users are up an astronomical amount right now on e-trading websites.  
	When Covid first happened, there was a large percentage of the US that was not financially effected.  This group of people also transitioned to working from home without a lot to do and were a more “well-to-do” class.  A lot of people thought about how they could improve their lives, family, house, income, etc.   At the same time, the gov’t had sent out checks for everyone that was basically free money.  Small business got loans received loans that look like they will not have to pay them back.  If they do pay them back, the terms are very generous over 30 years.  If you got fired, some people made more money; I did.  I currently make $660 in unemployment and $600 from Covid every week and I had a $75k a year salary. 

	My point is, there were a lot of people that had a lot of time on their hands and even more money.  There are many other variables as to why other groups of people started investing, but I think the category above covers a good 50% of my reasoning; (sick of the rich getting richer on wall street, millennials being more risk adverse, ease of use and technology now).
	If what I have said so far is true, then it is reasonable to believe how a herd mentality of in-experienced investors would work.  They put their money in, and their money is growing. In this scenario, you sit around all day and watch your money grow, you follow the herd and keep ionvesting more. Again, you can take this out at any time.   You keep putting in more and more spare money and watching your investment grow.  Obviously with a lot of people doing this, the stock market continues to grow.  The stock market is based off supply and demand, not how a market is doing.  They should correlate, but they do not right now.  
	
Why am I writing this, nothing bad has happened…. yet? I am writing this to tell you what is going to happen.

  I am certain that a second round of Corona is coming soon.  If that doesn’t happen soon, we will be seeing the effects of large and small business shutting down across the country at record rates.  If that doesn’t happen soon, we will see what happens when the government sends out a trillion dollars in printed free money to everyone.  My point is that we will be seeing a large dip in the stock market over a week here at some point this summer.  It doesn’t have to be a large dip with my theory, it just has to be enough to affect the herd.  Once a herd has been effected, there is always a tipping point.
	What happens when there is a large dip in the stock market with millions of new inexperienced investors sitting around watching themselves lose money all day?  What happens when suddenly their financial situation doesn’t look so great after maybe already spending some of their “returns”.  
  I’m sorry, but at some point the market and the stock market will correlate.  There will be an adjustment.  There are adjustment happens right now every day.  There have not been any major adjustments yet.   When there is a major adjustment a pretty large dip will happen over a 3-4 day period.  One of these dips will cause the herd to start selling.  That was their plan from the start, make some money while you can and take it out when it starts going down, it’s a good plan.  One of these large dips will cause the herd to tip and everyone will sell on one day.   We will see the largest stock market crash in the history of the United States.
Think of millions of new investors without enough savings clicking on their computers to sell their stock  in panic over a 2-4 hour period.  This is all going on while the news and social media is encouraging our behavior.



	In 2009, I was told the end of the world was going to happen if the big banks didn’t get bailed out.  This happened because a lot of people got approved for house loans and they shouldn’t have.  Basically, Bill Clinton said that every American should be able to have a house in the 1990’s and it resulted in catastrophe.   I am much more worried about the variables at play in 2020 then looking back at that scenario.


	What will happen?  Well, lower to upper middle class America will lose a good amount of money and it will probably trigger a small housing crisis, but they will recover in time and shrink.  The rich will get richer over time as the stock market recovers, and the rest of America will be fucked. I just thought of the solution, nice.

 	 Covid pushed every industry in America to further push their development into human less technology.  They already knew their profits would grow without labor as a cost and this pushed them over the edge. I thought I heard Uber goes from losing hundreds of millions a day to being the most profitable company on earth with driverless cars.   10% of jobs in America will be lost from transportation. Another 25% from cashiers, salespeople, administration, food processing, construction, finance, legal, etc.  
	Essentially, 1% will own 99.9% of wealth, 20%-35% will own 0.09% of wealth, and 60%- 80% of America will only own 0.01% of wealth (not enough to survive).  

   I am a capitalist and libertarian at heart, I believe in personal and financial freedom as much as the Raiding Vikings did, but it is just not going to work.  Our government will try to fix it by offering different forms of the Covid checks.  “People laid off in transportation industry will get extra in unemployment,”  “People affected in from Covid in the meat processing industry get more money now and if laid off for the next 12 months until it recovers.”   We will be a capitalist country in hiding that more closely resembles a Universal Basic Income structure. 

However, we will not have the efficiencies of actually operating as a true universal basic income system.  The only solution is to start working towards one now.  There will be huge pains in transitioning to a UBI, but those pains are worth taking on before the opportunity no longer exists. 

I guess I did come up with a solution.  If you agree with my theory, you should probably go and buy some SPXU stock.",1,wallstreetbets,1612109483.0,1612062102.0
