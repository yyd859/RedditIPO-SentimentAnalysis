1. You buy an ABC call at 100 on expiration Friday. ABC is at 90 when you buy it, so it's out of the money. Let's say it stays dead-on 90 all the way through to market close.

2. At, say, 4:30 PM, ABC trades at 105. You cannot close your position, as it is after hours.

3. At 5:30 PM, your option expires ITM. You expected it to expire OTM. You do not have the ability to manage your position, and if you wanted it to be exercised, you would have exercised early. Definitionally, this is something you did not want to happen.

That is pin risk.

---

> I bought a few call options near end of day just as a lottery ticket for fun.

This is a really, really bizarre thing to do. You said you bought calls, right? And they were OTM.

That is not a ""lottery ticket"". That literally doesn't make any sense. If you want to buy stock, just buy stock. Buying an OTM call and then waiting for it to expire ITM is only costing yourself money.

Look, if you want to throw away cash, just donate it to a charity or something, at least then it's doing something more than just going into an MM's pocket. If you want to buy stock, just buy stock.

If you want to make bizarre plays that don't make any sense and only open yourself up to risk, go to a broker that doesn't care about you, like RobinHood.

> I was absolutely fine with it expiring worthless and I most definitely expected it to.

Right, so the tastyworks risk management team actually _saved_ you money, then. You had something that was about to be worthless, at best, and they closed the position for you for at least a penny, right?

Not so-called. It's pin risk. So named because, generally, the option is almost or only just ITM at expiry -- the underlying pinned it.

And your broker closes the position because you can't hedge or manage it.

> Am I wrong in my understanding that in your first example the risk I (and therefore my broker) would undertake can only be the amount I paid for the call?

No. You risk the execution of the trade the option describes. If you bought a call, then fuck, you're out 100 times the strike of the call. You no longer get the choice to _not_ engage in that trade.

> If my understanding of that is correct then I don't see any reason why my broker would close my position after I specifically chose the option to stop them from closing my position.

There is no option to do that. There is an option that says you're monitoring your positions. If you want a way to ask TastyWorks to not engage in risk management, again, talk to their support team. I doubt they'll give you it, but hey, why not ask.

> Tastyworks doesn't gain anything from closing my position at 3:30 because the risk is defined and I payed for it. Despite how volatile GME is, at worst it expires worthless.

Actually, at worst the trade is executed, and then you can't sell your shares for anything even approximating the price you bought them for. Regardless, it is strictly a value negative position.

You have one of two wants. You either want to buy the shares, in which case, you should either:

1. Buy the shares at below the strike, because if the option is OTM then the market price is, inherently, below the strike price, or

2. Exercise the option (or, rather, sell it and buy the shares to avoid burning the extrinsic value, presuming liquidity exists).

OR, you don't want to buy the shares, and so closing the position is fine.

Frankly, if you think there is a third option here, you don't understand options.

> On the off chance GME skyrockets near close I could actually stand to profit.

Then buy the shares, if you want to be exposed to that potential. [Did you know you can buy shares before and after 4 PM ET? It's true!](https://support.tastyworks.com/support/solutions/articles/43000435382-how-do-i-place-a-pre-market-or-after-hours-stock-order-extended-hours-)

On the other hand, if you were assigned on your option, it's more likely that you wouldn't actually be able to sell those shares until Monday! Because option execution takes a while! So you might be _FUUUUUUUUUCKED!_

Seriously, it sounds to me like you bought an option as a way to do a rising buy. If you want to do a rising buy, just do a rising buy. Buy the stock as it rises. For crying out loud...

> You can say what you want but what I choose to do with my money is my choice.

Yes, but TastyWorks has a risk management team for a reason. Because you're their customer, and they give a shit about your money. If you prefer to not have your risk managed by TastyWorks, again, talk to support. See if they'd be willing to not.

> Saying that Tastyworks did this because they cared about me is about as dumb as Robinhood saying they prevented buying GME because they were protecting people.

No, really, it's probably actually more to do with TastyWorks wanting to avoid having to do a margin call on your ass.

Because that's unpleasant for everyone.

> I fully understood the risk and I clearly wanted to handle it myself.

I mean, you patently don't.

> What I did NOT want was to be restricted from buying due to PDT because my broker decided to close a position to save me a hundred dollars.

Sounds to me like you shouldn't have put yourself in that position, then. Go hit the PDT reset button.

Unless you can't, in which case, it sounds to me like you're actually a PDT, and all of this is actually you complaining about copping that hit. Regulations are what they are -- get 25k in your account or don't PDT. TastyWorks isn't in a position to change that.

---

EDIT: AHA!! I just realized what the fuck you're _actually_ up to. You sold GME earlier on Friday and thought you could get around PDT by buying a call and watching it go ITM, right?

Holy fuck you're dumb. And I bet you would have gone over your BP, too, given that would be roughly 32k of GME. And if you had 32k in your account, you wouldn't be subject to PDT rules.

[No, motherfucker, no. Option execution is automatic.](https://support.tastyworks.com/support/solutions/articles/43000472838-when-are-options-automatically-exercised-) This is not a TastyWorks thing. This is how options work.

> I already explained to you why I bought a call.

Yes, as a ""lottery ticket"", which is not what they are. Look, if you _genuinely_ think that, then fuck, you need to fucking stay the hell away from options until you actually understand what's going on. But I refuse to believe that you'd have an account with TastyWorks _and_ think that.

You bought a call option, which when executed would have forced you to go into a margin call, because you don't have the value in your account to overcome PDT, let alone the cash on-hand to buy 100 GME at literally _any_ strike on Friday, accounting for premium.

You would never have been able to execute that call without going into a margin call. There is _no_ universe where _any_ sane risk management team wouldn't close your position on Friday afternoon, because for _you_ to not do that shows, honestly, such a rank disregard not only for the risk you pose to your own account, but to the broker themselves.

I refuse to believe you didn't know what you were doing. But, just in case, don't fucking touch options again until you actually understand what they are and how they work.

Listen here, chump. Again. It's not just your money you're risking. The broker's cash is also at play. What if you fuck up and go over your BP, and then get a margin call that can't be resolved through liquidation? And then you refuse to pay your debt to the broker?

You have a business relationship with your broker. The broker is not your bitch. The broker is not your slave. The broker is not your waitstaff. The broker is your business partner.

No, dude, again, you didn't fucking ask TW to not exercise your option. And you only wanted to deal with PDT if it was going to net you five thousand dollars! So if TW hadn't closed, and your call was less than $50 ITM, it'd have exercised and you'd owe TW twenty thousand dollars.

390,glg6sy1,t3_l94v8i,"When DFV first supported buying GME, he did so because the fundamentals indicated that it was considerably under-valued at $4 per share.   


What is your price target What is your valuation? What do you base it on? $100,000 per share? Can you justify that share price based on FCF, assets and revenue growth, like DFV did when he justified buying at $4 per share?  


This group coordinated strategy can work, but only if it involves an exit strategy and price targets, with a way to unwind positions that doesn't burn the followers while the group leader cashes in. The group leader, i.e. DFV, has to act like a Shepherd for it to be ethical. He has to plan the exit. He has to evaluate the stock honestly, not only when he argues in favor of buying it, but also as the price goes up, especially when it ceases to be under-valued and becomes over-valued, which always happens at some point.   


DFV opened his position with an analysis that noted that the long-term trends are against GME, but in the near-term, it was under-valued. Have those long-term trends reversed since then? If not, when and how will he unwind the COMMUNITY's position, as a Good Shepherd would?  


If you do this right, you can accomplish something truly great. You can rebuild the Middle Class, by the millions, by coordinating small traders in an economic war with Wall Street. But only if you do it right, and you are very smart about it. Do not squander such an opportunity. Do it right. Be the shepherd they need now.",0,wallstreetbets,1612068761.0,1612068600.0

He's got to do something in between those two. And he needs to spell it out publicly, before he makes the trade, because a whole lot of people got into the trade ON HIS ADVICE (and he is a Certified Financial ADVISOR, so he knows this), and now they need to find a way to get out, before those long-term headwinds he mentioned do come into play (or else, he needs to use the community to change the company as activist investors, to avoid the headwinds and find new opportunity).

It's    time to get real and admit that not only do we have to hold💎🙌, but  then   squeeze🍋 and bleed them dry. I will tell you what I will be  doing based   on what I've learned in my two weeks here.

We    have messed with people who are absolutely going to do anything 👾to  get   out of this and will use every tactic known to mankind. They are   smarter  than us and have every advantage except one.  I propose this is   just  like 300 we need to HOLD💎🙌 then THRUST🍋 then STEP🚀🚀🚀.  Rinse and repeat  to make  any difference. Following knowledge of people  who know things  we don't  know. [https://twitter.com/KjetillStjerne](https://twitter.com/KjetillStjerne) . This is a much larger scene we need to step back and take a look at.

I    will be executing the ""The Afterburner""🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. Melvin and Citadel  I will  tell  you I can be bought right now for the low price of  $155,552. It's a   fucking steal! You'd be an idiot to not take my  deal.😅

Here's my position. [https://imgur.com/gallery/tnGKgEV](https://imgur.com/gallery/tnGKgEV).    I have set a sell strategy using my power of 2 theory from above. I    will sell four of my shares for $1024. Eight for $2048. Four for $8192.    Two for $16,384. Finally one for $32,768. I will under no  circumstance   EVER sell my initial 40 shares at $137.54💎🙌. I will  NEVER sell my ONE   THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR Nokia for  $4.84💎🙌. You can fucking   pry my 300 BlackBerry shares from my great  grand children's dead hands   on a planet orbiting Sirius A at  $18.85💎🙌.

My   galactic  empire🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 will be built on the back of these 3 companies. These    are TITANS😘🍪🥇 of Industry and I will be proud to stand on their  shoulders   and reach out to the stars🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. Or I will fail  trying🔥🤯. You have awoken a   monster you couldn't possibly have  imagined💩. The reason it's called ""The   AfterBurner"" is  thus🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This is my low sell. This will only cost you   $155,552 a  small amount of rocket fuel. That's chump change for you   guys. I'll  go away or my rocket will explode🚀🔥. Though you'll hear from me    again soon. BUT for every TWO market days you keep shorting these    companies, and manipulate the markets the price goes up. I BUY MORE💎🙌.  I   will buy 300 of AMC💎🙌. Put some $$ in Silver💎🙌 and BUY GME💎🙌.  It's the oldest   market mechanic on the planet. Supply and Demand. I  have something you   need so bad it could liquidate the entire world  economy. Even worse for   you the vast majority I'm never going to sell  to you purely because  they  are safely encased within my Diamond  hands💎🙌. I can't get them out  even  if I wanted to.🐒💎

I  haven't   calculated the high yet. It's in the millions. Do you realize  what you   would do if you let it go that far. You would have turned me  into your   worst nightmare. Not only am I already a monster but you've  given me   millions of gallons of rocket fuel🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. You don't  think for a second I've   told everyone I know? You don't think that IF I  make MILLIONS OF DOLLARS   off of you that all those people aren't  going to give me their rocket   fuel🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to put into our rocket🚀?  They know that I know how to launch into   space🌕. I've done it. I've  seen the light!

Either   way  you've lost. The gods have been cut, bleed hard and suffered long.   And  we've only started. You can hide this now for $155,552 but you're    only delaying the inevitable. 10 years. I will learn EVERYTHING you   know  with the motivation you've given me. I will TEACH everyone I know   how.  You are only delaying my empire. The people have spoken. They  want  out. I  will fight for them to see the light.

See you Monday. 💎🙌 [https://imgur.com/gallery/1ivtIvl](https://imgur.com/gallery/1ivtIvl)",1,wallstreetbets,1612074885.0,1612068384.0

Your argument is *not the same argument I made* -- I don't give a fuck why people are buying it, but I want them to know it is *SHOULD NOT* be because it is a squeeze candidate. If you're not saying the opposite about that stop arguing for no reason.

The real reason you're worried is that you think some people might dump the stock because that's exactly why they got in it. You wouldn't be so worked up otherwise.

My question, for those who have an account older than a fucking week, is what is the sense around AMC? I see a lot of differing figures on public float, and the waters seem a bit muddied after all that happened within AMC this week. I know it isn’t over 100% SI, but if the numbers of ~75% public float being shorted is correct, wouldn’t that still be ripe for short squeeze? Sure, there’s that wiggle room, but a large community suddenly buying in, like would be the expected result of bots pushing AMC all weekend, should drive the price up at market open, and from there I would expect the potential for an even greater spike to rise, this triggering hedge funds to cover, further boosting prices?

I’m more of an accounting guy, and less market-oriented, so I am less knowledgeable and looking for general info.

The float of GME is 50 million shares

The volume over the last 6 days has been 750 MILLION SHARES. EVERY SINGLE SHARE HAS TRADES 15 TIMES. (Not literally, but in essence).

The hedge funds who shorted early are OUT. Melvin got fucked! He had to get a 750 million dollar bailout. Fuck Melvin!

But the idea that this is some sort of class warfare, and that this sub has a hedge fund by the balls is total bullshit that's borderlining on conspiratorial delusion. People who continue to hold their shares will end up with nothing. There are new shorts at much higher levels, and they will end up winning because at the end of the day the company is severely overvalued. It will come back down to earth, and quickly. The only thing that may propel us further upward is total mania and disinformation. Not a short squeeze. 

BTW ORTEX is reporting short interest down to 34 million.

1175,glg8dnm,t1_glg6kna,"I think some people are saying AMC isn't a short-squeeze play because its short interest is nowhere near GME's 140%. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely not ""the next GME"" (no stock is), but its short interest is very much in play for a short squeeze - you're looking for > 20% short interest plus some good catalyst to kick off the momentum (like theaters re-opening or a buyout rumor). Short squeeze plays aren't that rare tbh (just look at KOSS last week, went 9 to 170 at the peak and it's gotten nowhere near the attention as the meme stocks), it's just that GME is an especially supernova example. 

BB and Nokia don't have a high short interest so they're not squeeze plays, but they're good long term stocks in sectors that are expected to be hot in coming years (cybersecurity and 5g). I have all of GME, AMC, and Nokia and am going back in for BB if it goes back down.

1187,glggan8,t1_glg7g29,"Personally, I am holding AMC for the following reasons: (numbers are approximate but you can look them up if you want better accuracy)

1. Current market cap is only $2.9B

2. They secured $917M to remove risk of bankruptcy and (wisely) sold stock into the recent rally, raising more than $600M of cash to pay off all the debt they had accumulated through renovations pre-covid and losses during covid. 

3. Before the pandemic, annual revenues were consistently $5B+ (2017-2019)

4. Before the pandemic, annual free cash flow was about $500M

5. Vaccine production and distribution is ramping up and people CAN’T WAIT to get out and see a movie!  The pent-up demand (and supply, from movies whose releases were delayed) is astounding. 

6. This stock had been in decline and another favorite of short sellers for a while because the “story” is that people are watching movies at home instead of going out, and eventually we will all just stream everything. I think that is wrong. I think people are fucking sick of staying home and WANT the big screen and community shared experience. 

7. They haven’t even scratched the surface of other opportunities (dine-in, eSports, concerts, business meetings, etc) to generate extra revenue. 

So, if you put a valuation of just 2x next year’s “projected” sales (cheap by today’s market standards) then that would mean the stock should be about $52 — and that is not to say anything about squeezing the short interest, which is between 42% and 78%, depending on what data you are going by.  They are also only 11% held by institutions so more opportunity for retail investors with 💎🙌 to determine their own destiny. 

Do they have challenges (I.e. streaming, film distributors)?  Sure, but here’s the thing: Wall Street was betting on them going OUT OF BUSINESS and they fucking survived!!  Just like GME.  So bow they’ve gotta figure out how to cover when they don’t want to take what are already big losses.

1278,glgbnqo,t1_glgaool,"Yeah, I’m starting to have some suspicions with what the true numbers are with AMC SI% after this week. I laid out one of my thoughts in another comment, but in general I see AMC as a solid spot for a longer position, as others have said. I think the risk is in expecting a short squeeze on it. At this point, and with how many bots are programmed to shill AMC, I’m all but certain that the SI% after this week is much lower than the sub as a whole thinks it is, especially the newbies. The hedge funds still had some wiggle room to cover on that one, and no doubt learned *something* from GME, so I would be gobsmacked if they went into 2/9 still being in a massively shorted position on AMC.

I think the hedge funds probably covered a lot of AMC this week, which is why that’s the stock of choice, rather than something else from the BANG gang. They can make a nice short-term gain on taking a long position on AMC and then selling right before next week’s market close, and before the true SI% is revealed. I expect AMC to rise next week from buy volume, and expect the hedge funds to capitalize on that, but I don’t expect any squeeze. Those who expect a squeeze, I fear, will be left taking the hit on this one.

I still like the stock and am in on it myself. I think it’s in a good long position and probably a good short term one this next week, but I’m suspicious and doubtful of any sort of squeeze",4,wallstreetbets,1612071798.0,1612068259.0
1279,glgakdm,t1_glg95l1,"Yeah, it’s actually turning me off to AMC a bit. Like, look at the shill responding to me less than 5 minutes after I commented to say something about “I like how nobody responded to you”? Like, dude, I commented less than five minutes ago. What does that have to do with my comment or question? It’s like they are programmed to comment some shill of AMC in response to any comment that mentions AMC, regardless of whether their response makes any sense in the context of the comment they’re replying to.

I like the stock, but it seems obvious that a huge portion of the population growth in this sub is from a massive influx of bots that are being run by the big players, which makes you really wonder why they’re pushing AMC so hard? AMC is supposedly shorted hard too, but we won’t know the true numbers until the 9th. They could just be trying to get people to divest from GME, but then I’d think that they’d want people to divest to something that wouldn’t hurt them as bad as the supposedly second most shorted stock out there. It makes me think that AMC isn’t nearly as shorted as we think, and only the hedge funds know that.

My thought is that it’s possible they covered their positions on AMC and may have bought long puts on it, and now they’re pushing AMC as a two-fold attack in order to divest people from GME, so as to lessen the damage they sustain covering that, and to push prices on AMC so that they can turn a profit on the price bump that’ll occur from an influx of buy volume. Retail traders would end up holding the bag on that scenario, as they would be buying with the expectation of a short squeeze that wouldn’t be coming, while the hedge funds would wait to sell when the price is pushed up from the buy volume influx. When numbers would release on the 9th that show the stock isn’t nearly as shorted as was believed, the price would tank, and the hedge funds would’ve already exited, leaving retail investors holding the bag.

I’m not a financial advisor and I’m not giving any advice, but I could very easily see this being the play that is being made right now with how hard the bots are pushing AMC. It makes a ton of sense in my monkey brain",1,wallstreetbets,1612071084.0,1612068259.0
1280,glh67d6,t1_glggan8,"This is a well reasoned take. AMC seems more of a long position, but I fear a lot of newbies that missed GME when it was $15 a share are desperately searching for the next one, when there is no next one. They see it in AMC and blindly follow any highly upvoted comment or post from a bot that pushes AMC as being a short squeeze target, when that is highly unlikely right now. It looks good for what you say, but my concern is for those who end up going big into AMC tomorrow expecting a squeeze, only for share value to drop next Monday when short float numbers are reported lower than they thought, then triggering a mass sell-off where all of the newbies will part with their shares and lose a lot of money.

1363,glh5r2w,t1_glgm1ey,"I get it. I’m not saying everyone pushing AMC is a bot. But do something for yourself here: every time you see a highly upvoted comment that says something simple to the tune of “AMC TO THE MOON🚀🚀🚀” or “AMC AND GME TO THE MOON🚀🚀🚀”, or even “Buying 5k more AMC Monday” click on the profile. Legitimately about 3 out of 4 of them are either less than one week old accounts with activity *only* pushing AMC, or its a less than 1 year old account with zero activity until this week, all being activity for pushing AMC. These are bots. 

Now, there are real people too, like yourself, but you have to ask yourself, why are all of these bots shilling AMC? Who is behind these bots and what is their goal? Logically, and pretty obviously, these bots are being run by the suits in Wall Street. That much is a no-brainer. But then why would the suits be pushing the stock that they have supposedly shorted so heavily, similar to GME? Why would they do something that would obviously only hurt themselves? The answer is that it won’t hurt them.

The bots being run by the suits in Wall Street are pushing AMC for a reason that we don’t exactly *know* yet, but it should raise some red flags for all of us. I’ve got a couple suspicions on it myself. The short float right now is not the 78% that’s been getting quoted a lot around here anymore. It’s now about 44% by best estimates. Still decently sized, but clear of a short squeeze already in all likelihood. It’s obvious that the hedge funds want people to divest from GME, which pushing other stocks would do, but then why AMC? Well, this could be because they’ve covered their shorts already last week, *which is actually possible, unlike the situation with GME that we know to be false*. If they’ve covered their short position, then driving people from GME to AMC will lift a small part of a huge burden off of them. They could even go further and buy long positions on AMC in anticipation of the stock price driving up from purchase volume next week, on account of their bots pushing AMC so heavily. If they do this, they would sell before the week ends when prices are high, knowing that when short float numbers are reported the next Monday that they would already have made out with their profits prior to prices dropping.

I’m not a financial advisor and these are just my suspicions. I like the stock for now, and so see it as a decent long position stock. Just don’t be a fool; if your opponent is putting in huge amounts of effort to get you to do something that would seem to hurt them, you need to be asking why instead of blindly falling into their hands. They have more information regarding their positions than we do and they’re going to use that to their advantage.

750 MILLION shares have been bought in the last week. That's enough to cover the entire short position almost 10 times over. None of the things you are saying about shares being borrowed or lent changes this fact. Melvin covered their short. They had to get a 750 million dollar bailout because it fucked them. Good!
