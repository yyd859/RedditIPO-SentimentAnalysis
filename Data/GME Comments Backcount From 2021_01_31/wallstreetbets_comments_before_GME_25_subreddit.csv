This first set of rules was put together by a broker named William Diamond who realized if too many assets in the stock market moved at the same time it could cause a crash.  As he pushed for changes in the SEC laws he found another broker who had connections with big firms named Barney Hands *(which had been one of the few brokers to survive the recent stock market crash)*.

Together they created a new list of rules that would prevent large hedgefunds from taking over parts of the market. 

These four rules were: 

1) Hand off stocks

2) Order in bulk

3) Liquidity

4) Devalue

I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

- gamestop would definitely not sell shares for 150 to the 🌈🐻, that would be throwing away free money and selling their own soul. You already mentioned this though so I will not delve deeper here.

- we don't know which share millennium shorted and bought in 2012, so we don't know the market value of the share which they got fined for. We do know that 284k out of the 600k fine was based on ""illegally acquired money"", so we can deduct that money was the price of those 40000 stocks they bought for a reduced price, or at least the difference in stockprice, so that would come out to 7.1 dollars per share. Now, if we apply this logic to the gme stocks, they would be fined 58 million x 350 per share (or 200 if you only count the difference in price) which comes out to 11.8 to 20.3 billion dollars in fines, excluding interest, which in the case of millennium llc. Was 51k on a fine of 284k, let's say roughly 1/6th of the fine (for the 🌈🐻 this would be a higher cut because the fine would be higher so interest % would be higher) so add 1/6th, you would get 13.5 to 23.8 billion in fines. Then they would still need to acquire those shares, lets say at the 320$ mark, because this is a big short threshhold, so add 18.6 billion and they would pay inbetween 32.1 and 42.4 billion dollars to get out of this squeeze.

226,glf362n,t1_glf2y2p,"What if Citadel and Melvin are going long?

Isn't it possible that they just opened up longs to hedge? (Or just buy the equivalent amount of shares, meaning they are slowly just accumulating?) If you have a short at $40 and you long at $90 then your losses are capped at $50 per share? Fees and interest not included. No matter how high the price goes they would always be capped at $50 losses. 

It's stupid but it's like opening a long and short at the same price - you can't earn and it's a zero sum game.

If they suddenly dump the price from $500, and close all their longs (or sell all their shares) they could profit significantly if their average sell price is $400 and they gained on everything from $90 to $400. 

So now not only did they make multiples on what they lost with the short, by profiting from the long, but if they induce enough panic selling and paper hands fold they could eventually bring their shorts closer to a zero sum game.

I don't know enough about options to understand if my idea is even legitimate in any way, but what if they are just going long with us? Egging us on,

So perhaps that injection of capital didn't go to cover margin requirements but to open up longs when we were below $150s? That huge spike from $150 to $350...that doesn't feel like a million coordinated buyers. That was just a giant swallow of the supply.

You're way better off locking in your losses with a counter directional position as a hedge, than acting like a sitting duck adding more capital to your account to lose. 

So is the reason we're stagnating at these $350 prices because they keep buying up the price to $400 or $450, more retail money follows as we spread the word, and they are dumping on us a little at a time. Small gains. And potentially closing out the shorts a little at a time?

Based on my novice understanding of hedging, as institutional money I'd have locked in my losses as soon as I got that injection of capital on the 25th. Go long. Then egg on the opposition and cry like I'm a sore loser. Entice everyone to stick it to me. My longs double, triple, quadruple. Every dip at the top is me taking profits at the top, scooping up the lows. With so much volume no one would ever know. 

Is this a possible strategy for them?

I love what you guys have done.

What pisses me off is the the media, they have completely misportrayed you.  Yes, you are a bunch of fucking degenerates, but I have been shocked by how welcoming you guys have been.

After being here for 4 days, it seems like 4 months, I have learned so much... to the point I find myself screaming at the TV when their not explaining things correctly...  I literally did that tonight.

As far as DFV, he can sell his shares on Monday and he will still be a hero to me.   In fact, a part of me hope he does, because I want him to be worth 45 MILLION, and not risk it all.   Its a fucking shitty end to the story if he doesn't walk away with at least 45 Mil.

Books are going to be written about him, Movies are going to be made about him, I just hope he is portrayed accurately.  I have watched a few of the videos, and OP is 100% spot on about him.

To all you other warriors, good luck this week.  I don't have much skin in the game, but I am not selling my 4 shares until at least 4K, and even then, the decision will be based on the percentage of Shorts still out.

Would be great if  [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/)  would say at what price he would sell $GME.

His SELL LIMIT ORDER (Info that is already provided to hedge funds by RH and other brokers if you trade ). 

We all agree and also set our  💎🤲  to the supreme leader's price and only that price.   

Every share holder gets paid! Hedge funds will hold the shit bag ! 

[u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) WINS ! Tards of the world are happy and fat because of the tendies ! Stimulus money will help economy! Charity will increase! Hedge funds are left with $420.69 in their bank accounts ! Cuz we are not assholes.

just my opinion and I'm not a financial adviser just wondering if this would be possible ? I trust supreme leader [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) DD. His youtube vids are very well thought out.

They figured out that massive gains would get upvoted to /r/all and drive new users to the sub. This was the same time he started shilling his trading academy all over the sub and was trying to get paid subscribers.

It's not a coincidence that WSBGod basically disappeared from Reddit the second the head mod got banned from WSB.

All I'm saying is I watched some video he put together about 100+ Activist investors with like 640mm to throw at this trade.  If that's the case why are we not at the moon already? That's 2.1mm shares...

Surely this twitter account is just some other autist with maybe 50k in stonks trying to convince you that he is some whale here to protect you, feeding off your emotion.

I don't disagree that there are billions behind this, in fact I think we are just along for the ride in a battle between the billionaire elite, no?  I am bullish don't  get me wrong, I have 2700 shares at a \~35 cost basis (been averaging up). 

I just don't want people to get irrational thinking that there is some whale there holding the line that won' let the stock drop.  The reason for this is that if we do have a repeat of this week where we see a \~$470 -> \~$120 event happen again, if someone thinks there is suppose to be a whale there to stop it, and they don't it might cause them to paper hand and sell.

&#x200B;

TL/DR:  There is big monies behind this and billionaires on both sides but that doesn't mean the stock won't see wild fluctuations so brace for wild swings this up coming week and stay in as long as you have the conviction too and it's still what is best for you and your own.",2,wallstreetbets,1612052421.0,1612047383.0
