Point72 is 17 billions. 

The market cap of gme at its high was more than both combined.

So tell me again how "" gme its not going to do anything to citadel ""?

At 500 per share gme market cap was as big as citadel point72 and Melvin and Citron combined",4,wallstreetbets,1612058726.0,1612051123.0

What do you think they do HFT with ? Their piss? No its with the capital under management.

I'm sure you have zero understanding of what's going on and how hedge funds work,  their capital structure.

477,glfppau,t1_glfov8z,"I think you’re over estimating how many shorts expired Friday 

While GME is shorted about 118% right now that’s total shorts eg including new shorts bought that may expire months from now
Realistically ~70% of the shorts or less expired Friday and I’m guessing they have means of covering a good amount eg 20% because of what robinhood did (70% is still a fuck load)

They definitely still owe money but they likely are making money off the hft (which accounts for nearl 60% of money made of stocks in general each year) and by buying new shorts that expire in a month or two for when it crashes

Also it’s distributed mostly on Melvin with some other hedges in there 

They will owe some money but I doubt it’ll reach an amount that will seriously damage them 

They will definitely have an overall loss but they are doing things to mitigate it 

Although I will admit there is a possibility to fuck them because if we hold until their new puts expired they are doubly fucked and there is evidence they are selling their longs (shit quants told them to buy the golden ticket positions) to cover their shorts which means they are expecting to pay out 

I’m just speculating that wsb won’t hold on long enough to drop a nuke 

Also in case you think 70% is not 100%
Tesla was shorted 30% and soared like a motherfucker after a squeeze from hype buying so there is still gonna be money",1,wallstreetbets,1612059461.0,1612051123.0
478,glfqduy,t1_glfppau,"Shorts don't expire, what are you even talking about. You can't short share and then let it expire. You have to buy it back  gme short interest is at 113% currently. Float is 65 million. They have to BUY BACK 113% of the float. They DONT expire. 30% short did that to Tesla now imagine what a 113% short would do. I'm not even gonna bring up the gamma squeeze from almost a million open call contracts all the way to 800.

They owe what they have to buy back. It's not they will "" owe some money "" its more than 50% to more than 100% of point72 and citadel capital combined depends on how high it goes.

Please go educate yourself and understand what's going on before you look like an even bigger fool",3,wallstreetbets,1612059824.0,1612051123.0
479,glfqt0d,t1_glfqduy,"They do expire 

What expiry means is they start to pay interest everyday that they don’t give back the shares

And people already exercised the calls we had our gamma squeeze it was right when robinhood shut down buying and they short laddered

A lot of people won’t execute calls on the day of expiry they will do it earlier however I’m sure the spike at the start of day Friday was the last of calls getting executed

And 113% is the total short not shorts due Friday some of those are probably due weeks from now",1,wallstreetbets,1612060044.0,1612051123.0
480,glfrz6c,t1_glfqt0d,"Omg you are so retarded, topped with lack of understanding of short and options that it's actually pissing me off. Your logic is also assbackward.

They are paying 30% interest rate on their short position, at current share price, the interest rate on such a short position alone is going to kill them.

Gamma squeeze isn't a one time event that occurs once. Look at tsla . 

So now they are stuck between paying 30% on atleaat 15 billion short 

OR  

Cover  which would cost them 30 to 100 billion dollar. 

The only way out is to bring the price down to teens 

Citadel has 33 billion 

They are paying minimum 4 billion interest on short of it stays around these level for a year 

They neeed 30 to 100 billion to cover 

Now math time is 

33 billion capital , 30 to 100 billion margin call 

"" they have HFT"" 

How much do you think make ? They average 20% annually thats 6.6 billion a year revenue from 33 billion assets under management 

How useful is HFT when you have $0 or in debt ?

What's 30% of $0 ? ZERO FKING DOLLAR

The volume for etfs holding GME has shot up 5 fold during that period 

You have to understand why everyone is so annoyed at your post, even though you know  the whole media is blowing up, they are doing all these dirty tricks, you still fail to realize none of these would have happened if they werent hurting REAL bad

Then you claim losing 80% to more than 100% of the money that's not even yours "" its just little , won't hurt them "" yes the 33 billion is asset under management most of them belong to millionaire clients, its not even theirs 

Then you fail to use logic that say : "" yeah its okay if they lost 30 billion dollar out of 33 billion asset because they have HFT

Like you are indirectly claiming they are making 30 billion plus per year from HFT without even using any capital
