6,gle8kg9,t3_l8s621,"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

If each share of GME has two owners and a counterparty who is indebted to one of those owners for the value of a share of GME, why shouldn't everyone on the planet spend all the money they can afford to gamble with to buy shares of GME until each share has one owner?  The shorts will buy.  They must.  The question is when, and at what price.  The value of GME has nothing to do with Gamestop and everything to do with game theory.  The shorts placed a wager.  Their reasons for placing that wager do not matter.  Only the terms of their wager matter.  What were those terms?  At some point in the past, the shorts decided to borrow the value of one Gamestop share \*now\*, and in exchange, they agreed to repay the value of one Gamestop share \*later\*.  They had beliefs about what a Gamestop share represents, and beliefs about what makes a Gamestop share valuable, but their beliefs do not matter to me.  What matters to me is that when the value of a Gamestop share times the number of shares an entity sold short is greater than the value of that short seller's current liquid assets plus the amount their creditors will allow them to borrow, the short seller is forced to lock in losses and spend all of their money to purchase Gamestop shares to cover their bet, ending up with nothing and transferring their wealth to the shareholders.  Our target isn't a price.  Our target is one owner per share.  Fuck the shorts.  Let them double down.  And quadruple down.  And octuple down.  More shorts is more money for the shareholders when the shorts get liquidated because they don't have enough assets to equal the value of the shares they promised to repay. I see no reason why we shouldn't continue to buy GME at any price until the shorts have closed their positions.  The value of a Gamestop share is the dollar value at which every short seller has closed their position and each share has a single owner.  No less.",14,wallstreetbets,1612031630.0,1612031532.0

20,gle6jnv,t3_l8s621,"Well - they’re not missing anything they are willfully misrepresenting.  The entire market - ever aspect is speculating - in layman’s terms - gambling.  Period - full stop.

If they are honest and say that - then why should or would someone need “experts”.  It is all about making markets seem as complicated as can be so people think they need way more help and guidance than they need - so the “experts” make money.  Are there underlying vehicles and maneuvers more complicated than buy and hold - of course - but you don’t “need” that to become wealthy.

A lot of investments are made in a thesis - some are good and some are weak - regardless - they aren’t always right.  You can have a 5 page write up on why you believe AAPL will go to 150 by EOY - you could also just say they sell a shit load of phones computers and services.  The latter is simple to understand - the former says the exact same thing in just a shit load more words - so it seems like someone is smart and put a lot of thought into it - so let them manager their money.

TLDR - game was never about the fundamentals - ever.

21,gle6js2,t3_l8s621,"Well, holding GME stonks (longs/options) is a legitimate investment/trade.

It's up to you what is a legit investment - is it Pokemon cards, GME stonks  or autographs of your wife's boyfriend?

I hold longs in GME and I will keep them with my diamond hands.  💎🤚 I've said that, if Yellen or Powell is the one taking away mah stonks and we don't get to Alpha Centauri, then so be it. Not much I can do about it. At least I had a fucking unbelievable journey holding GME through the hellfire. This will be a part of Wall St history, folks. Even that 1 GME entitles  you to that. Whatever happens next, I'm cool beans.

So why do I see my GME trade (HOLD, good until:  🚀 Alpha Centauri 🚀 ) as an investment that's legitimate speculation?

First  of all: any investments are always speculation. Yes, even that savings account. Nobody fucking knows for certain will ATT or DOW be around in  20-30 yrs, paying quarterly dividends. Yes, those less risky (read:  without any balls) will tell ya only that's an investment and anything else is risky/gambling/speculation/you name it. And yes, they're likely to exist, but nobody can guarantee that.

Just like the short side of the game has the right (unless  using illegal naked shorts) to speculate and invest in a sentiment that  the GME stonk is overpriced at $X, I have the right to speculate their short stake is overvalued (read: overvalued as in target price and  percentage shorted). That's a fair game and it's legal to speculate on it (FYI: the VW short squeeze didn't end people in jail and the same was the case with KaloBios Pharmaceuticals).

It's also good to speculate with who has the biggest dick in the cookie jar.

P.S. I'm an ape with a keyboard, so  do your own conclusions. This was just education about autism. SEC: do I  need to send an autist certificate from the zoo vet? And no, I don't  have a degree in law. But: ***I have stonks I like!***

It would have never gone further if the shorts had accepted a loss at 60. 

Original value play:
- GME bought back 700m of debt
- console cycle ( shorts thought it wouldn’t happen thanks to no discs in new consoles, were wrong)
- 3 generations of user data ready to be used or sold

User data is gold now. Ryan Cohen knows that and addressed it in his letter to them. He’ll address it from the board and he may address it when he’s CEO.

GME can’t capture market against Amazon and steam? Why not? Nothing is a given. Chewy got laughed out of investment rooms for the same reason but customer forward e-commerce won the day.

Ironically, this campaign has helped the turnaround. GME is inexorably linked with a new generation in a fuck Wall Street move that THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT.

It was just a value play until it eclipsed 60-80.

The Reddit pile on happened AFTER GME had already proven the shorts were wrong and they wouldn’t go bankrupt in 2021.

I personally think Robin Hood may have an actual cash problem already in however it makes no sense that they would unless they were somehow involved in the shorting of the Gme themselves. The only reason they would have a problem with liquidity or cash would be if the stocks crashed and people were on margin and now they were on the hook for the money so there's no reason for them to have a problem with inflows of orders since they are now trying to raise money and have raised money supposedly, what is really going on at Robin Hood I would highly suggest that you  transfer your accounts to a different platform using a Dtc method for faster transfer. Just the perception of them going out of business or potentially closing the ability to trade the stocks that we like turned the stock negative all the stocks turn negative so we must make sure to protect ourselves.   2nd scenario is that investors shorted call options and when it went up the accounts went negative the debt was theres to eat and they already lost a ton of money that way !",0,wallstreetbets,1612035338.0,1612031532.0

All large investors publicly disclose their largest positions, no matter if long or short. When we think about asset prices, they are being determined by supply and demand. Does the market ask what your reasoning behind buying or selling a stock is? No! It is the mere order that talks to the market, and the aggregate of them that affects prices. This is a easy-to-follow causality chain.

If so many believe in $GME, $BB, $NOK, and $AMC (among others) and publicly disclose this information, buy the stock and hence drive demand, then it is their free will.

298,glejztj,t1_gledvpq,"My stance is, you can buy whatever you want for money you earned. But artificially creating bubbles can cause a market crash. Did you look into any fundamentals of those companies, how is their profitability, their margins? It can be a good company, but still lose money. Of course, there are bad actors in the market. But market's purpose is to distribute, invest money between companies to match their growth/needs. But if everyone just throwing ridiculous money in 1 stock because you like the company?... I just see it's as infantilism, and irresponsibility. And it's not much better than what Melvin did. I'm not saying you can't buy what you want. I just want people to grow up, and be more rational and responsible. You will make short term, probably a lot. But there will be repercussions. It's so obvious in past few weeks there's a lot of underage kids lamenting here. That what scares me. Would you put 12 yo kid to run your business/economy? 
And another thing about SEC, my friend. If they cared about stopping market manipulators, there would be no 140% shorted shares of a stock.

This may be true, I’m still long for just a little less than $700k in an account, and I’m not letting go either.

however, just note that in the run-up to earnings, everything is uncertain, people are both hopeful and fearful. They want to bet big and they want to hedge their chance of loss. Implied volatility goes up huge, it’s a measure of how much people are willing to pay to bet and/or hedge.

No matter whether Apple smashes earnings or flops, uncertainty goes away. Implied volatility dies. This is called volatility crush. It always happens right after any announced event.

Even if you had bet directionally correctly, you would have lost money if you were only playing one side, unless the earnings report caused even more uncertainty about the future prospects.

If you have a directional bet on an event, use a spread of some sort. Not only does it hedge max loss if you’re wrong, if you’re right, the other side of the trade will offset some of the volatility crush.",9,wallstreetbets,1612043510.0,1612031330.0
