If this happens it is very unlikely that we will get an infinite squeeze even a squeeze at all cause AMC short percent could significantly drop. GME on the other hand has for more early investors who understand what’s going on and people who will simply refuse to sell (portnoy’s 1 mil for example, DFV won’t sell till the peak at least for example). Factor in that and that the ex chewy ceo dude has 13% of existing float and I doubt he will sell. Therefore GME “true” short % is 140% off the chewy CEO alone. Only thing that could possibly screw over GME investors is that a large portion of stock (~20% I believe) is owned by investment groups that give short sellers stock for a fee.

but to answer the question specifically ... you can do this through your broker but it may cost you some cash ... all brokers are different ... even if the stock you purchased only trades electronically you can still have them issue a certified electronic document (in .pdf) that you own xx number of stocks ... however RH or many others may be a pain to do this and cost tens of dollars or even a couple of hundred ... the best way to do this (leg work) ... especially if you are buying for 1 share or even 100s or whatever shares for the long haul ...

1.  Find your companies yearly/annual statement - in the statement the SEC requires them to list a third party or contact for their ""company transfer agent"" ... much of the time this can be found on company website for investor relations but not required.
2. Contact them and have them send you paper issue for 1 or x stocks you own or a signed/certified .pdf for 1 or x stocks.  You can also call them to buy stock for a very minimal fee ... until recently much more cost effective than broker online costs.  Now, if you bough a stock on a online broker, prior to this contact have your broker transfer the number of shares to your legal name.  Online brokers usually keep stock in their name/address for ease of transfer through clearing house when bought/sold.  Explain to them why you are doing this and they should ... even RH should do this or if they won't contact SEC.  The company transfer agent will then issue you a paper certificate ... if an electronic stock they will then send you a certified .pdf upon request for x shares.  Keep in mind  if the stock is officially transferred to your name they may require it to go through a clearing house transfer to sell it which may take a couple of days if you mail it back or have them sell it for you.  Of course, everyone has diamond hands so no need to worry about that ... or in my case ... diamond fins ...
3. As stated ... the best way to do this is work with the companies transfer agent ... using a website that sells you any stock certificate or whatever is going to charge major markup and it may only be a replica to hang on the wall not an actual piece of stock.

1. The Electronic Registration DRS statement takes 3-7 weeks after ordering. I assume the site acts as a broker registering your share during market hours.
2. ""As of Aug. 2013, GameStop stopped issuing paper stock certificates and registers ownership electronically instead."" - ""*Available only for companies that either 1)* *do NOT issue authentic paper certificates* *or 2) as a lower cost alternative to companies that do issue authentic paper certificates but charge a fee to do so.""* So if you call your broker they can't just convert your GME share for you. Even if they could other posters are saying it costs upwards of $500-$1000 for companies that do offer paper certs.

There’s tons of reasons to fundamentally love GME, but the main fundamental reason to love GME is due to the contractual obligations of short sellers to acquire more shares than currently exist on the market.

727,glf2ok1,t1_glf0uci,"Everyone should also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Then consider moving to SoFi, since Chamath is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and is offering probably the best alternative.

8. Others have mentioned (and I'm still trying to understand) that if Robinhood collapses, it's possible that we might only be compensated for up to 250k or 500k, which a way the medium guys will get screwed if RH becomes a sacrifice to blow up any wins. Hedge funds would never have to be concerned about that; they'll get bailed out. I don't know what to do with this information yet, but it should be on your radar.

9. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

10. Join a class action lawsuit against Robinhood + others even if you don't have Robinhood but owned any GME, AMC, etc. Their actions were market manipulation and caused significant losses. Document evidence of owning the stocks (it will be in your Robinhood or other broker's history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, you should join as a Named Class Representative for outcomes specific to you. These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud. Details are still coming.

11. I would not recommend buying while the stock is going up. Let the stock dip before you buy because there will be a lot of attempts to make that happen. It's more valuable to us all if you get more stocks, and since we anticipate a lot of dips, it's sensible to wait until the right moment to strike. Buying right when the day opens and everything is rising is not my idea of sound enter strategy.

12. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

13. It's also worth investigating the other grossly unfair (some legal, some just easily masked) attack vectors they use against us. They always win because the game is rigged. Please remember that this is more than about making money, it's about a movement.

14. For everyone saying hold until zero - no, that leaves all the little guys holding the bag in the end. We do need you guys to have an exit strategy. There are institutions also holding the long side of this trade and they would LOVE for you to hold forever. There is a mathematical squeeze coming (if no illegal actions can bring it down), but we DO need to exit squeeze positions at some point for it to be a win.

Problem is this so a huge one-sided trade, Robinhood does not have the liquidity to settle and cover these. For the case of Apple, most robinhood users will have put in approximately (+/- 20%) that money into the account and not have sick tendies and gains. For GME, this is an unprecedented 10x+ (way more for options) float that will not be able to be covered with cash deposits. If everyone in RH sold their GME and withdrew, the balance would be in the billions, which RH never received in cash deposits due to the exponential growth of the stock. It would have to float this cash to the user, until the clearing house transfers are complete and I am sure that RH does not have enough cash on hand to cover everyones chicken tendies for the 2-3 day settlement period. This will require a several billion dollar transfer in assets from HF to RH users, which is why they had to draw on a credit line.

Tldr:RH will have to have billions on hand for wsb sick tendies, but wont receive those from brokerages until 2-3 days after settling. RH doesnt have liquidity to float the money.
