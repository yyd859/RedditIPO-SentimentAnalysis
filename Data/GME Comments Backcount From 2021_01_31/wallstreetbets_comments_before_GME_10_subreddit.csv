THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards. This is for all of us who sat at home and despaired at the fact that we knew the system was broken, wishing we could make a change. Well, we're doing it you stupid monkeys.

169,glg13s3,t1_glfuk2d,"Options contracts are basically a bet that a stock will reach a certain price point (strike price) by a certain date (expiration date). 


If the stock doesn't hit your option strike by market close on the expiration date, your option expires worthless (literally $0). For that reason, options set to expire in 1 or 0 days with a strike price above the current price of a stock (out of the money) are extremely cheap since they essentially a bad bet.



However, if you believe a stock will see a sudden spike in price, you can buy cheap out of the money (OTM) options at 0 days or 1 day to expiration (0dte or 1dte) for extremely cheap and sell for a massive profit when the stock spikes. 



For instance, on the morning of Jan 22, you could have bought some 0dte GME Jan 22 60c contracts for as little as $3 a piece. When the gamma squeeze happened, those same options reached a peak of $1500+. If you bought 10 and managed to sell at the peak, you'd have made $15,000 on an initial investment of $30. 


Keep in mind, this type of strategy is EXTREMELY risky. It's basically like winning the lottery. More often than not, the stock never hits your strike, or worse, it does but for a very short window and you miss it.",4,wallstreetbets,1612065474.0,1612060007.0

He got very lucky as Ryan Cohen was announced to have joined the board on the 12th I believe, and was the news this stock needed for the short squeeze to begin.

Honestly and this is only my own speculation is I feel like the first wave of bots was cambridge analytica and the second wave was russian/Asian influence.

They steal from the poor to give to the rich

How fair is it to short 150% of the shares

And then when WSB comes everybody cares

In 2008 they stole our jobs and our house

In 2021 but those hedgies it's the time of the mouse

The little guy, the amc, the gamestop

When they took our money where was the sec cop

Other long-only funds realized there'd be short coverings in basically all stocks with heavy short interest (AMC, BB, GME, SKT, and a shit ton of other ones), and so long-only funds started accumulating as well in an attempt to push the shorts out of it. 

Basically it's been a market-wide momentum switch attempting to chase the shorts out of literally all of their ""bleed-them-dry-slowly-over-years-until-they-bankrupt"" positions. Will that continue? No idea. It's possible it does. It's also possible that both sides of the market start directing all their firepower at only GME in an attempt to win one clear decisive victory and handle the rest of the battles later.

Whether it’s marketing, propaganda, or market manipulation these bot operators have probably already done it 20 times before in some capacity and have done their homework on a sub like this to be ready to blend when the order comes. Plus reddit gives them amazing tools, between upvoting and gilding they can quickly boost a comment or post and greatly enhance its legitimacy for a nominal fee they pass onto their client.

665,glftk5k,t1_glfqzei,"I'm also transferring after the squeeze. Currently up like $200k in GME in RH. Can't do much else since it could happen immediately.


My plan is to trade normally and monitor the app and desktop version like I usually do. If there are ANY issues people are having with selling (not buying any more in RH), I will immediately begin recording myself and what I'm doing. Show the time, prices, what I'm trying to trade and how much I stand to make.


If something doesn't go through, I will document EVERYTHING. I will then contact the SEC, NYSE, FINRA, my local news, my congressmen, lawyers, etc.


It's one thing if we're fucking around with a few bucks. But I have potentially millions on the line in this stupid thing, all because I YOLO'd like $5k. There's no way I'll just accept a DoorDash gift card or some bullshit. If I'm unable to sell my securities, you better believe I'll be suing the shit out of Robinhood and making it publicly known what happened.


That being said...I don't think it'll be all that likely. I think a lot of people left the app, which is actually good for people still on it. They were clearly overwhelmed with the sheer volume and had liquidity issues with the clearing house. Hopefully they have enough capital now to cover, but I expect worst case scenario, we're able to sell, the funds just hit them hard and they deal with the clearing house over it.


Not being able to SELL a stock is different than restricting buying, as much as that sucked. People can't technically lose money if they can't buy. But if they can't sell? Yeah, they can lose everything. That creates fear that the market is not to be trusted, and we can't have that.

749,glg3znw,t3_l9246n,"I literally bought in the 2s and kept averaging up because I love my AMC A-list and I'm so exhausted by streaming and watchparties (Wonder Woman 1984 was a bad movie but made doubly bad by the fact I had to watch on my laptop), I need to watch on a big screen to pay attention and I miss going out to the movies with my friends. And I know a lot of my friends feel the same, the moment theaters re-open we're going back out - there's a massive pent-up demand for socializing right now that movies are a prime scene for fulfilling. With enough money in the warchest to survive the year now even if they can't re-open, I think the risk-reward is pretty good at this price - it's still cheap, it's not going to drop to nothing because they have no bankruptcy worries, they're pretty much the only player in town now (because so many indie theaters have died :() and there'll likely be good news as more and more theaters reopen. 

The short squeeze potential ofc is a big bonus. Please note that even if it's nowhere near GME's 140%, anything above 10% is already good, above 30% is VERY good for a short squeeze and I'm pretty sure AMC is minimum 40% atm from every estimate I've seen (eg [finvis](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=amc) has it as 44%, highshortinterest at 79%). It was heading for a price in the 30s in premarket earlier in the week before the restrictions, it can do it again but we need to get everyone off the shitty platforms like Robinhood.",3,wallstreetbets,1612067097.0,1612059566.0

If you can't afford to loose it all . setting at 100.00 for the amount of stock it takes to recover of your investment is a smart play . And then maybe after that setting the second limit an 400.00 or higher just to let it ride . I see that for some . For me I put in some of my gains from last year . I believe that this needs to happen to level the playing field . While they are stealing pensions and sucking the average Joe into bad trades with over hawking sells while they  short the hell out of your unwatched 401k investments , nothing is going to change.

The truth is Gamestop as a company was and is shit, terrible, AMC is the opposite. It's a good company. But the quality of the company isn't what the concern is here, it doesn't matter who's going and doing this or that, what matters is what outside forces (for your retard brain-WSB and hedge funds.) are doing.
