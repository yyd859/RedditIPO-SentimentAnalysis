I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

While we had checks to prevent this from happening (the clearing server would not approve trades without a valid quote for the security to validate your buying power, among many, many other checks), if a trade made it past the clearing server there are absolutely no account related checks past that point, since once the trade is approved to send to market there is no further connection with your account information other than to note what account the trade is associated with.

As I recall, if we didn’t have a valid quote we would request it from the quote server and would not confirm the order until we had it...or something like that. 

If you wrote software that only took the bid/ask and didn’t validate that the quote was good, I could see orders going out with a $0.00 or some other nonsensical buying power impact. 

It’s also possible that their quote server told them they had a valid quote when they really didn’t. Obviously, I don’t know what their code looks like.

839,glftzqr,t1_glf5bir,"THE END GAME, for GME only, is that Marvin and the hedge funds go bankrupt or don’t have enough capital to pay to cover the short-sells outstanding.

That’s why it’s critical you hold and never sell your GME. So they can never cover those short sell contracts.

When they bankrupt, they’ll go to THEIR CREDITORS the big banks, who will “lend” them the money to pay all the GME HOLDING HAIRY APES.  Remember what Trump says, if you owe the bank $100 and can’t pay, it’s your problem.  If you owe the bank $100 million dollars, it’s THEIR PROBLEM.

If banks can’t pay, they’ll go to the Fed, who’ll then print the money to pay us.

EDIT: that’s why all this shilling for AMC, NOK, BB etc etc is obsfucation BS shilling. 

Because the short-sell float % is less than 100%, short sellers (institutions) on those tickets can buy out their position anytime they have enough money (you think they can’t buy out existing available  AMC at $13 and would risk a GME situation at having to pay $350+?).

That’s assuming the institutions haven’t closed or are prepared to close their short positions already.  Note that Silver Lake already sold off $713 million shares and the market didn’t move. 

IF THE $713 mill AMC SHARES WERE SOLD  “OTC” TO INSTITUTIONS, YOU WOULDN’T SEE ANY MOVEMENT IN THE PRICE ON THE EXCHANGE MARKET.

With every other stock besides GME, the one paying out will be the poor chump Ape holding the bag when everyone else has sold off their stock.

It’s sorta pissing me off all the shilling and BS lots of people are spewing to shill their stonk and make $$$.  Only GME has the real exit plan that doesn’t involve Retail buyers holding the nut bag and losing money (because GME had more than 100% short-sell float contracts, so literally couldn’t buy enough stocks to cover their position ... you can’t buy more than 100%)

At open the American market is correcting itself after some of the international markets close because they also trade American stocks and Wall Street needs to incorporate that new data into their strategies.

I’ve found waiting until AT LEAST 9:45-10AM EST to consider a position to be some of the best times. During the lunch period 12-1/1:30ishPM EST volume is low and usually things take a rest. That is also a good time to see if volume on the buying side will continue its momentum after lunch or if there just won’t be enough buyers to take it over the edge.

When the sales by retail were restricted, GME dipped to $118 and then back up to $255, after which the stock stabilized. This allegedly reduced float with 20% to 120%. We can therefore conclude that:

1. most hedgies are unwilling or unable to cover @ 250+
2. covering 20% of the float raised prices $137
3. if noone buys but the hedgies buy, for every point of float they offload, the price increases $6,85.
4. this means that even if the price where to drop to $1, the buying by hedgies would drive the price right back to $250 and only reducing the float with 36,35%.
5. conversely, if all shareholders do not sell below $250, and only hedgies buy back, the price would rise with $822 if all float where to be eliminated.

Conclusion: Buy. Hold. They are so deep in that the price could go to $1 and they would push it back to $274 THRICE over. The longer it takes the more likely it is a hedgie will close higher and higher. All paperhands, you are safe to hold, even if it dips all the way down to 1$, three times.

1236,glgj1bm,t1_glewnkk,"No, the gist of the article is correct. Many state pensions (CALPERS, I’m looking at you) funnel large sums of cash to various hedge funds, private equity funds, VC funds, and other investment vehicles that are accessible only to [Qualified Institutional Buyers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qib.asp). Consequently, QIBs, whose ranks include many large pension funds (notably, though, not Nevada — that’s definitely a story worth reading up on).

Pension funds dole out enormous sums of money to myriad funds and money managers, many of them very high priced. Pension fund customers present a very lucrative opportunity for asset managers. Although it’s slowly starting to be negotiated down, traditional hedge fund fees were (and many still are) 2/20, meaning 2% of assets under management per year and 20% of net gains per year (usually upon or after meeting some minimum required IRR, like 6-8%).

But yeah, don’t believe the hype. Setting aside any negative systemic effects of the GME bubble, pension funds aren’t losing their shirts because a few hedge funds that have some investments from some pensions made a bad bet on GME.",1,wallstreetbets,1612077243.0,1612044302.0

I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

I keep seeing your posts all over the place called $822 the top. Covering shorts is not linear, it's fractal, as all squeezes are self-similar. In other words, exponential growth is expected, and your argument doesn't make sense.

The fact you post this all over the place makes me think you're trying to convince people 822 is the top so they sell. I'd expect the next jump to be up to 800s based on the aforementioned self-similarity. It does no good to make people think the shorters have covered in the event the price goes 800+, its just the mathematical principals at play. But you probably know that and are trying to get people to sell earlier...

Quit pretending like you know the future or can call the top. No one can.
