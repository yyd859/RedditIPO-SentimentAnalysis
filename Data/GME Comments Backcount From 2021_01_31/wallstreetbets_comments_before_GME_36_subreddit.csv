I live in a pretty low cost of living area. I could live a comfortable life with my SO and a child on 35k a year. At present my SO and I make a combined 24k/yr. while working our day jobs because we haven't gotten into investing.

You many not time the peak but there will be a huge buffer between the top and where it settles to after MOASS. Just have a number in mind where you wanna cash out.

The short sellers are large institutional investors.  They made a strategic play and did not count on Redditors boosting a heavily shorted stock.  Yes, they are going to lose a % of their money, but then they are going to move on to the next thing.  There are also large institutional investors like Black Rock on the other end of this and stand to gain from their loss.  The ""billionaires"" are not interested in you.  Some billionaires will gain and some will lose.  

You, on the other hand, will actually take a hit on this if you do something unwise financially. If you think $GME is a good investment, go for it.  But do your due diligence and don't do it with money you can't afford to lose.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)

""What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode, is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new view, to create a fiction.""

""Then you call the (Wall Street) Journal and get the bozo reporter in Research in Motion and you would feed that (rival) Palm's got a killer it's going to give away. These are all the things you must do on a day like today, and if you're not doing it, maybe you shouldn't be in the game.""  

“It might cost me $15 million or $20 million to knock RIM down but it would be fabulous because it would beleaguer all the moron longs who are also keying on Research in Motion.""

""A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... meaning I needed (a stock) down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game.""  

""Who cares about the fundamentals? The great thing about the market is that it has nothing to do with the actual stocks.""

379,gleotih,t1_glemox5,"Everyone should also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Then consider moving to SoFi, since Chamath is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and is offering probably the best alternative.

8. Others have mentioned (and I'm still trying to understand) that if Robinhood collapses, it's possible that we might only be compensated for up to 250k or 500k, which a way the medium guys will get screwed if RH becomes a sacrifice to blow up any wins. Hedge funds would never have to be concerned about that; they'll get bailed out. I don't know what to do with this information yet, but it should be on your radar.

9. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

10. Join a class action lawsuit against Robinhood + others even if you don't have Robinhood but owned any GME, AMC, etc. Their actions were market manipulation and caused significant losses. Document evidence of owning the stocks (it will be in your Robinhood or other broker's history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, you should join as a Named Class Representative for outcomes specific to you. These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud. Details are still coming.

11. I would not recommend buying while the stock is going up. Let the stock dip before you buy because there will be a lot of attempts to make that happen. It's more valuable to us all if you get more stocks, and since we anticipate a lot of dips, it's sensible to wait until the right moment to strike. Buying right when the day opens and everything is rising is not my idea of sound enter strategy.

12. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go $GME!! I am one of you guys!"", usually with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Just don’t be afraid to increase rent because at some point too little cash flow will actually cost you more if you don’t have sufficient funds to maintain and improve the place.

615,glemso9,t3_l8v8js,"PSA: Be aware of the most common strategy used by hedge funds right now: Divide and conquer. PROTECT $AMC

We are all aware of the bots here on reddit and other social networks advising people not to buy or sell $GME, by reading the threads you will start to find accounts telling you not to buy or sell $AMC and other stocks we like. 

Be aware that they have interest in those stocks too, these people are greedy and every penny counts to them. If they have a chance to kill $AMC first, they will.

For those who haven't figured it out yet, here's what I'm trying to explain: thanks to the hype many people are starting to invest, there are many people who want to join the battle but can't afford a single share of $GME, so they are interested in buying $AMC instead. But since they find redditors here advising not to buy $AMC they give up and don't support the battle at all. This is the strategy of hedge funds.

AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us) 

Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that. 

Today’s target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)

So Monday when they’re forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher. 

But this isn’t even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96 in the upcoming weeks.

My advice: Take EVERY SINGLE hype post with a very large grain of salt, regardless of what stock it is for. They are fun but they are borderline useless. Instead, pay attention to quality DD posts and make your own decisions. This is generally what the people that got in on GME months ago (or sooner) did.  

These kinds of quality DD posts are getting drowned out or not posted right now because what is happening with GME is historic and people are excited (including me... who gives a shit about the rest of my portfolio right now, it's nothing compared to GME), but paying attention is how you get in ahead of the next stock to post huge gains.

715,gleprwk,t1_glengq3,Oh wow thanks for explaining how it works so I should buy AMC right then ? And just hold it correct ? Is AMC the next GME? I was told the other stocks that are valued under $5 is a blufff,2,wallstreetbets,1612041204.0,1612039454.0
716,gleocvh,t1_glenz16,"Because of the momentum and the fact that it's one of the most heavily shorted stocks. 

There's enough people wanting to get onto the next GME that AMC, BB, and NOK will probably see gains regardless. I personally like AMC because it has a natural rebound, meaning it will likely see long term gains regardless because of the end of COVID.",1,wallstreetbets,1612040513.0,1612039454.0
717,gleooh4,t1_gleo5oe,"I am by far an expert on this topic, but from what ive learned the last few days about this is that the reason why it works with GME is because it’s high short%, a lot of people don’t realize this and think the only factor of all this happening is the amount of people on this. People only looking for a “new option” to be there at the beginning of it so they can make a lot of profit, but this just ins’t possible with any stock.",1,wallstreetbets,1612040669.0,1612039454.0

722,gleq0uj,t1_gleooh4,"It also wasn't just the high short percentage. That's a huge part of it but you can short a company at 6,000% of the float but if the company goes bankrupt, the shorts make money.

GME, even two months ago, was a bit different because it was shorted and valued as though it was going to go bankrupt but it had a lot of positive things going for it. New activist investors like Ryan Cohen, stock buybacks, lots of cash, upcoming monster sales from the new console cycle, etc. 

For a short squeeze to happen, the price has to first go up. AMC, for example, has issued new shares to survive and was still openly saying it was on the verge of bankruptcy. It lost a bunch of exclusive rights when Warner announced movies in 2021 would be available on streaming. There are new strains of COVID that might shut us down even longer, plus the ongoing vaccine rollouts are not a going smoothly and could last well into the year. Etc. AMC got funding to help hold it for a while longer but it is still in a very rough spot (and if/when it comes back it will have to deal with interest on those massive loans).

Personally, I think AMC is a mirage/momentum and not the same as GME, and I've made trades accordingly (holding GME stocks/calls and AMC puts) but with enough momentum, anything is possible.",2,wallstreetbets,1612041326.0,1612039454.0
