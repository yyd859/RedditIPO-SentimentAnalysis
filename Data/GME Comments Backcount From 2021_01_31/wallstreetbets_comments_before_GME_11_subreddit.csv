Most new users to TD AMERITRADE will not know this, so I felt like with the new influx of users that this was valuable information which I feel morally obligated to share.

YOU ARE NOT GETTING REAL TIME QUOTES.  This means that the price information etc you see on the TDA mobile or web is significantly delayed.  By default, your account will be set to DELAYED.

To enable real time quotes (it’s FREE):

(1) Go to the TDA website.
(2) Go to CLIENT SERVICES —> GENERAL
(3) Under EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS (lower right corner) you will see NASDAQ, NYSE, OPRA and your status.  They will say unsigned.  Click here.
(4) On the page that comes up will be the contract you need to sign.  Click the necessary boxes (it requires you to open 2 pdf agreements but there are no actions you need to do, just close them after you review them if you want) and set your STATUS to NONPROFESSIONAL.  At the bottom, click save.
(5) Log out of TDA.
(6) Log in to TDA.
(7) Go to CLIENT SERVICES —> SUBSCRIPTIONS 
(8) Under AVAILABLE SUBSCRIPTIONS click on the blue SUBSCRIBE link next to REAL TIME NASDAQ LEVEL II QUOTES.

Voila. You have real time quotes across all TDA platforms.  If you want to verify this has worked in TDA mobile app go to:

MORE—>SETTINGS—>PERMISSIONS

Scroll to the very bottom.  Had you not enabled real time quotes or did something incorrectly you would see DELAYED next to NASDAQ NYSE OPRA.  If you did everything correctly however it will now say REAL-TIME.

To update your TOS MOBILE to reflect your changes: after you have done the above steps on the TDA WEBSITE, login to the TOS WEBSITE and logout.  If your settings were updated, you will no longer see a ribbon at the top of your screen in the app that says delayed.

Happy investing everyone.

We want to take this stock out of orbit and past the solar systems fucking plasma wall. 

Like several people have mentioned across wsb the suits could easily let the stock hit the $1000 mark and then start doing their standard short ladder attack to trick people into thinking the short squeeze has been squoze and then short from there to cover their losses. we can't let them recover one fucking cent.

Understand that the strategy is simple if you like the stonk then buy and hold $GME until you're lost in space.

ITS A CLASSIC PRISONERS DILEMMA

Everyone’s holding strong, but we’re afraid the other person will cave. That makes fear, doubt, and increases the likelihood that we could cave.

The solution: NO SELL LIMITS BELOW 20K

When the squeeze comes, it doesn’t matter what the price is, they just need to find that many positions to close in the order books equal to the number of shorts they have.

If everyone sets their sell limits above 20k, then the prisoners dilemma is solved

Gives everyone an out where they win
Gives everyone a target 
Removes the doubt of when to close: set your sell limit and forget
Strong enough incentive to hold until then

It also is a really strong selling point to draw in new money and force the price up more, and force the squeeze. Buying GME at $350 is retarded. But “buy below 20k- set your sell limit above 20k - easy money” is a strong fucking selling point and great return.

WE HAVE THEM BY THE BALLS. All she shorts will need to be closed. THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME SITUATION

I calm it THE BIG BALL SQUEEZE

Got bigger balls? Set your sell limit higher. But NO SELL LIMIT < 20K and we are laughing

Now let’s assume that only the initial 2m followers of this sub are for real (our exponential growth definitely includes hedge fund shorters and other bears). That means that on **average each wsb retard should have 20 shares to fully cover the float** ... you can argue that some people are sidelining - but from what we’ve seen on other posts, those who are holding, usually hold more than 20 shares - DFV alone covers for 2500 people with his 50k shares.

Don't BET more than you can afford to lose. Read the last four letters of this subreddit. Repeat it several times over.

We are a bunch of retail RETARDS (can't spell RETARDS without the word TRADERS) who have no connection with each other or hedge funds. We just like the GameStop stock.

There is no guarantee you will make money from GameStop. WSB is a subreddit primarily known for glorifying LOSSES. We just have a retarded idea that this BET will make money and are doing it for the memes.

The decision to buy and WHEN to sell is on you. We are not guiding or advising you. Do not wait for us to tell you when to sell.

I have a few shares of GameStop which I am happy to throw away into the bin, just to potentially be part of history. Diamond hands forever.

Don't look at people betting their life savings or education course fees or celebrities posting tweets and feel obligated to join in on the short squeeze. NO ONE knows how this will end, the government will NOT bail you out.

The better question is, what comes next. I honestly expected government intervention. I didn't see it coming from the very brokerages we use to trade openly manipulating the market. I think its just a mask the government is using to protect themselves. Hedge funds are 1) either selling off their assets to cover their losses and/or 2) purposely tanking the market to blame it on retail traders to push for more regulation. We saw this on Friday. Just look at the graphs for normie stocks such as apple, amazon, microsoft, etc. For the most part they look pretty similar, suggesting centralized sell offs.

The Biden Administration doesn't want a bad economy. Hedgies are going to tank the s&p  500 in order to pressure them to go after us. They will use their media connections to spin the gamestop shit as being our fault when we aren't the ones in majority control of normie stocks. Assuming the posted leak from Robinhood HQ was true and they were receiving calls from the White House, this further cements my argument.

The interest is currently 30% on existing shorts, and 50% on new ones.

Interest rate is normally single digit, so this is really really expensive for those guys.  


The big thing, is happening on the **option market** \- That´s where they have an expiration date - Could be a week, month, several months etc.  


On monday and Tuesday, they have to find those stocks, (as they were due friday at the bell) for the option market (Chicago) , which would mean a higher demand on buying stock on the stock market (New York) , which normally increases the price.  


On Nasdaq, you can see the options which are due on monday, on both bets, and puts (Bets are long, (increased price) and puts are short (a lower price) - Each option is 100 shares.

But when the poor make money back they all complain and they bitch
How fair is it to short 150% of the shares

And then when WSB comes everybody cares

In 2008 they stole our jobs and our house

In 2021 but those hedgies it's the time of the mouse

The little guy, the amc, the gamestop

When they took our money where was the sec cop

Robinhood You sell us 1 share while the hedges buy all

I believe that we all will hold. I hope that enough of the casuals will hold, at least for a while. I pray that the principle stockholders of GameStop won't be greedy, thankless, chicken shit little pussies and cut some kind of behind closed doors deal with Melvin / Citadel.

The good news is that it's getting more and more expensive for the hedge funds to keep pushing this. They've already lost billions, and they haven't even started to cover. Each illegal action we recover from makes their options narrower and more costly. Closing above $320 this week was a gargantuan win. So many calls will be exercised.

435,glfu9qx,t1_glfs4w9,"No clue how this works, but I'll take a stab:

A. The price is too high to launch a sustainable ladder attack. We saw it ""tank"" on Thursday and the impact was minimal. The retail advantage in this case, people aren't flinching and are buying more. Chaos, yes, but a counter to their counter.

E. The attack works better with a company holding a small market cap. GME being something like 70MM, I don't think they have enough access to the shares they need. 

B. The attack works better when the company is less visible. In recent days, every hedge fund, trading site, and clearing house has been placed under a microscope. 

G. The attack works better when working within valuations of reality. GME is nowhere near the $400/share value (in-fact closer to the $4/share value) it's holding. Hence, why everyone wants WSBetters to HOLD. Force them to keep buying higher and higher and maintaining the unrealistic value.

THIS IS A REVOLUTION. For decades wall street has profited off our backs, manipulated markets, crashed our economy, and laughed the whole way through. For the first time, we've collectively agreed its time to end this trend and expose these frauds for the scum they are. We are a decentralized force hell bent on putting the power into our own hands. Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards. This is for all of us who sat at home and despaired at the fact that we knew the system was broken, wishing we could make a change. Well, we're doing it you stupid monkeys.

“I keep hearing that ‘most of the GME shorts have covered’ — totally untrue,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 managing director of predictive analytics. “In actuality the data shows that total net shares shorted hasn’t moved all that much.”

“While the ‘value shorts’ that were in GME earlier have been squeezed, most of the borrowed shares that were returned on the back of the buy to covers were shorted by new momentum shorts in the name,” Dusaniwsky added in an email.

The borrow fee on GameStop’s stock — or the cost-to-borrow shares for the purpose of selling them short — jumped to 29.32% on existing shorts and 50% on new short positions, S3 said.

“If most of the shorts had covered, we would not be seeing stock borrow rates at these high levels — by now you would be able to borrow GME stock at single digit levels due to an increase in the lendable stock loan supply due to borrowed shares being returned after all the ‘supposed’ buy-to-covers,” Dusaniwsky said.

GameStop remained the most-shorted name in the market as short interest as a percentage of shares available for trading stands at 113.31%, S3 said.",5,wallstreetbets,1612061645.0,1612058533.0

If the price goes up a bit higher, retail purchasers will start to find it too expensive. This put more power in the hands of HFs. 

Add to that, that I think (the skpetic in me) that now, there are big boys on both sides of the trade. While WSB may be in the spotlight and loud, when it comes to the actual paper, I'm wondering if the big boys aren't simply using WSB as cover for them trying to take out their competition. So, yet again, the retail guys are just along for the ride and at the mercy of the the whales. 

What I can't figure out myself is, if retail holds say 10% of shares outstanding, and the short interest is still high, doesn't retail still wield enough power to dictate how high the price should / could go?

1. Melvin returns 1000 GME stock to the ""GME SL"" (60 Millions -1000)  
2. ""GME SL"" secretly or under the table (whatever you call it) sells back the 1000 GME stock in better price than the Market price.

So right now the hedge funds have borrowed more shares than anyone owns. They can’t buy any shares to pay back what is owed until people sell the shares. This is why we must HOLD. There is high demand (the hedge funds need to buy your shares because every day they don’t they are bleeding interest) and low supply (cuz diamond hands ain’t selling). People selling shares set an “ask” and people buying shares set a “bid”. If buyers come up to the ask then the price of the stock raises. If sellers settle for the bid then the stock lowers. People are buying at ask and raising price and there isn’t enough volume being sold (cuz diamond hands) for the hedges to buy what they owe. So low supply and high demand means the seller sets their price.
