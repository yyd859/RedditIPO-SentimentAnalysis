Whats next,

GME either goes to $1000, good luck but even so, yiu only trippled your money there. 

THERE ARE NO 10 FOLDS FROM HERE ANYMORE

OR

GME goes to shit, which is what everyone is thinking

GME has to raise money so they can reap the fruit of the share price jump.

YOU HEARD IT, THEY WILL RAISE MONEY AND THIS WIL KILL THE MOMENTUM.

but you believe what you want 

BB just started

BB CAN INCREASE 10 FOLDS FROM HERE 

I BET YOU DONT KNOW WHY

EV, CYBERSECURITY, QNX, IVY, SMART CITIES AND BB NEW 5G PHONE

MAGA is over, america will start buying BB again
SO DOES NOK YOU CREEP

BB GOING TO $100

NOK GOING TO $20

AMC NOT SURE BUT THEY HAVE A MASSIVE DEBT AND THEY NEED TO RAISE MONEY

GME GOOD LUCK IF THEY DO NOT RAISE MONEY, KUDOS TO THEM IF THEY DO, BUT IT WONT BE AT 300 AND NON OF YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED.

So many people investing who seem unaware of this.

#GME was never going bankrupt in 2021.

I got into it cuz I was looking at Covid recovery plays and looked at AMC first, but decided they’d probably go bankrupt.

I stumbled on DFVs DD and the first thing that caught me was GME buying back **800m** of debt.

*Hmmm.... that’s not what a dying company about to declare bankruptcy does.*

Then I read about the console cycle, Ryan Cohen, the shift to e-commerce...

Along the way I found out Blockbuster never had to die, but they had an activist investor prevent them from pivoting. 

Ryan Cohen wanted to capitalize on GMEs gold mine of user data and capture e-commerce market cap from Amazon and Steam.

Could this be possible? I mean, he did it with chewy after people said it was impossible for the same reasons.

I bought call options at GME price 13 dollars figuring console cycle would get us to 16-20 easy. 

Then Ryan Cohen raised his stake...
Then he hired that corporate takeover lawyer....
Then GME put him on the board...

Molon labe (Ancient Greek: μολὼν λαβέ, romanized: molṑn labé), meaning 'come and take [them]', is a classical expression of defiance. It is among the Laconic phrases reported by Plutarch, attributed to King Leonidas I in reply to the demand by Xerxes I that the Spartans surrender their weapons. The exchange between Leonidas and Xerxes occurs in writing, on the eve of the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC).

I am not an advisor
I am holding cause I love gamestop and want to help them.

I'm not selling, holding till I die.
But I will take the dividends I earn through this stock.
I'm then going to a gamestop to buy what ever consoles I can. Going to then donate them to children's hospital.
That way I can help gamestop and children while hoping the EPS goes up so I can buy more for those kids.
