Yeah, I am sure there is a small subset here (especially since membership grew like 200% this month) that are here for that. But if you have been around long enough, you know the things the people here like are YOLOs and big wins or big flops. Nothing in between satisfies. Also inverseing people’s trades just to try to mess with them and prove them wrong and be able to point at them and laugh a week later. I think that is what the $GME trade is about.

We just really want to see an epic fall for the shorts and massive wins for the longs, since that fits our criteria. To try to spin this into some kind of class or political warfare is just a bunch of Bullstein.

17,glfdklj,t3_l8zure,"So while signing up for Fidelity I noticed in the Terms they offer a Stock Loan Program.

TLDR: They will allow others to short your owned stocks and pay you part of the interest generated. They require 250k in the account it seems unfortunately, and IB seems to have a min of 50k. I couldn't find a min for WeBull and their page on it makes it sound like there isn't one. Just ""when it's on this is what happens"".

Normally this wouldn't amount to much for a single stock, but what with GME this makes for a prime opportunity.

Now imagine the following scenario:

An autist moves their holdings into one of these wonderfully opportunistic accounts and generously allow this hedgies the privilege to borrow their stocks to cover their shorts. Yet for this privilege they will have to pay them interest. Then when the contract is up they will have to borrow from someone else to pay them back. Rinse and Repeat.

So long as they are shorting all of this they are paying interest and as many others have pointed out, much of that is going to other hedgies that are silently riding this wave. They hold the majority of the stock...currently...and so they reap the benefit of the interest being generated on this crazy prices. Would sure be wonderful if the common individual owner was able to profit off this nearly never ending stream of revenue. Never ending so long as they can never get their short positions below 100% and completely close their positions. And it will only get better the more they short and raise the interest rate. So long as said autist above maintains his DeepFuckingValues and never sells they will never be able to use anything but loans to trade around and pay their shorts. Loans on loans on loan on loan on loans....each one with a drip of interest on the tip. Interest that will add up significantly and allow said autist to expand his holdings and that ever increase that pre-release drip of interest.

THIS SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED. The market was manipulated to prevent the short squeeze and the media is in on the act as PR for them.

I know Bloomberg staff the best; these are people plucked from investment banks, Ivy League schools, and the rest; they're elites who have a worldview that the elites should be in power and are genuinely better, smarter people than people in flyover states, truck drivers, etc. As a result, when something like the GME story pops up, their assumption is that the hedge funds are doing nothing wrong and WSB's upending of their short is an unnatural or wrong action. They may not say so directly, but when they interview people (who will be almost entirely from their own coterie, note how the only WSB people they're interviewing is the one fuck who started the sub and isn't even a mod anymore?), they're going to give more latitude to statements that benefit Wall Street, benefit the status quo, and paint normal people as ""bros"" or a mob or whatever.

Silver Lake changed their convertible loan to equity to sell for profit because us ABSOLUTE APES are squeezing it super good. It may dip. It may not. Just don't let the news stations scare you, because they will keep trying to get you to sell.

I don't see no lakes. I'm on the moon and it's so retarded it has no lakes.

Hello all,

Greetings from Berlin.

Im am new to Reddit. So please don‘t mind me posting here. 

I had no idea what is going on with GME and AMC and I am relatively new to trading. By chance I got involved... Some weeks ago I did look out for some stocks for my my first investment.

I stumbled about AMC and I believed that they might endure the crisis. So bought stocks. 

You can imagine my surprise after they went up. Of course I was happy and they kept going up. That is when I started to investigate why they went up like that. Then I found out about this community. 

You can imagine how fast I had to learn to understand what was going on. That‘s great in many ways.

Now I need your knowledge and advice. 

I still have 320 AMC stocks in my portfolio. 

Now the question is what to do...

I can not risk to lose much...

Should I sell the. right away on Monday or keep them?


I would appreciate any advise. 

Thanks!",2,wallstreetbets,1612098943.0,1612052483.0

579,glggh53,t1_glfis5i,"Dude, check Friday's chart for AMC. It directly correlates with GME. Even the steep rise at noon and the rise when all the $250 limit orders of GME kicked in half an hour before closing. Only because people think we all invested in both makes it rise (which lot of us did). There is no real squeeze yet but that one will be probably caused by the GME squeeze. Monday morning investors worldwide will try to get a piece of the cake too.
Worst case you make a small profit of $20 till 50$ a share next week. But with a potential to go >$200.

There is no distraction, buy whatever you want. This is no coordinated attack (illegal duh). We are just retards gambling. There are enough people buying shares as long they don't restrict anything again tmr. GME got the best potential but also the risk because surely they think of a way to fuck us. BB and NOK didn't correlate with GME at all. So if you want to play it more safe buy some AMC. It's a nice stock anyway and with corona once gone it will be a stable one longterm. With all the attention right now they will find a way to get out of crisis. So even holding 💎💎💎 it through a squeeze won't hurt that much. That's just my opinion as a retard.

This isn't /r/politics, /r/the_donald, /r/political_humor, etc. If you choose to start arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.

Nobody cares about your political opinions. If it's not about taking advantage of the political to make money then leave that baggage at home. WSB is not the stage for your lazy political regurgitation nor will it be used as a propaganda mouthpiece by anybody.

The whole theme for two weeks is to fuck over the suits, the hedge funds, and the Wallstreet big wigs. And it’s working. People are holding GME knowing they are 100% likely going to lose money, but it’s going to expose some shitheads in the meantime.

They steal from the poor to give to the rich

But when the poor make money back they all complain and they bitch
How fair is it to short 150% of the shares

And then when WSB comes everybody cares

In 2008 they stole our jobs and our house

In 2021 but those hedgies it's the time of the mouse

The little guy, the amc, the gamestop

When they took our money where was the sec cop

Robinhood You sell us 1 share while the hedges buy all

Cuz u bitches loves shorts, we love the call

So In summation, for decades you steal our home, cars

They have realized that the biggest con game in town has been the rigging of silver prices. Banks have been heavily ""net short"" silver for years. If the price of silver stays low, the perceived value of the U.S. dollar remains relatively intact. Increased buying of silver – which we saw today – might actually force some folks on Wall Street to consider where they would find a place to buy and store more physical silver themselves. As Garrett explained in his update... If everyone buys some silver, the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) and Sprott Physical Silver Trust (PSLV) exchange-traded funds will be forced to go into the market and buy physical silver. Unlike stocks, physical silver supply is finite. The overwhelming demand will spike silver prices higher. The large banks use futures contracts and other derivatives to short the silver price. Right now, they are short hundreds of millions of silver ounces and stand to lose billions of dollars with every $1 rise in the price of silver. This morning, silver traded up more than 5% to around $26.30 per ounce",-3,wallstreetbets,1612052147.0,1612052017.0

1140,glhb5or,t1_glfsqji,"Thanks Caluso - if the shorters do choose to immediately sell on that share and double down their shorting, doesn’t that put even more of a squeeze on if the masses hold their position?  Wouldn’t that incentivise us to not set limits? Please can you explain why it isn’t it true that they will need to buy back at the higher price we set?  Aren’t they going to be paying loads of interest to lender on doubled down shorts if they don’t?  Does the interest rate vary according to share price or is it fixed at point of lending?  Sorry i’m new to all this and none of it is obvious to me, i’m an idiot! 

But I love everything that’s happening and it’ll be a win win either way.  The fuckery that will be going down next week will be part of history and expose these companies for what they are.  A few billionaires going down making a few million interneters a bit richer would be icing on the cake.  If we can sustain this and hold on then we have many cakes no?

I get that loads of newbie investors will get spooked into selling by hedgefund fuckery, and that a lot of greedy people will sell early if it starts to rise....what if it doesn’t go down that way this time though?  What if the internet really is crazy and people decide to be stupid? What would actually happen if we all held or doubled down?  If the masses decided they could afford to buy and hold their little bit?",1,wallstreetbets,1612102169.0,1612052017.0
