In the United States of America, individuals and corporations pay U.S. federal income tax on the net total of all their capital gains. The tax rate depends on both the investor's tax bracket and the amount of time the investment was held. Short-term capital gains are taxed at the investor's ordinary income tax rate and are defined as investments held for a year or less before being sold.

219,gleakym,t1_gle8m61,when the shorts are out the price will fall... a company can do nothing with stocks which are overpriced unless they can sell themselves... otherwise they are rich in assets but short in cash... and no company can survive in this situation... so they can only prosper when they sell the stock that they own (cf tesla a couple of weeks ago) or print new stock and sell this to the HF’s. GME is only worth the $ that you can get for it. I only have C R Y P T O’s the only asset that can’t be reproduced. but I admire this David against goliath game... but I do’t trust it...,1,wallstreetbets,1612033984.0,1612029710.0

225,glesrb1,t1_gleq8vp,"if the financials of the company don’t match the shareprice the company is called ‘overvalued’ and if this company goes to a bank to get a loan it is not the share price or the market cap that the bank will evaluate but the actial business numbers. So if the numbers don’t add up, the only way to get cash is selling stock or making a capital increase (at the actual prices this is very attractive) but the company is still overvalued... so nobody in his right mind will participate. Only the shortsellers who desperately need stock. So doing a deal with them is not a bad idea...
