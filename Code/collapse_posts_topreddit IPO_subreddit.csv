If anything, it is going to Balkanize. It will be ugly and not a good time.**

Few people want to read books on reddit so I am going to keep this one short(er). If you want the long version, I [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/m1duoa/the_united_states_is_following_a_pattern_of/)^1 [them](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/oj18x4/an_examination_of_modern_conflict_an_analysis_of/)^2 [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/oj1al6/an_examination_of_modern_conflict_an_analysis_of/)^3 If you don't like reading, Robert Evans' podcast ""It Could Happen Here"" is a good introduction to these concepts. All sources are linked at the bottom.

Anyway, the term ""civil war"" has been in mainstream new cycle as of late. Of course many people balk at this idea because they cannot imagine this happening. It must be impossible in today's modern world with all its complexities. The problem is that those people still view ""war"" in the way it happened in the 1940s: two big sides, attacks and counter-attacks over lines on a map, money and fuel and infantry on the ground trying to outlast each other, etc. It doesn't work like that. War hasn't worked like that for at least the past 50 years.

The signs of a coming civil collapse can be watered down to four indicators:

**1. Freedom and rights are disappearing.**

The two wings of our neoliberal political system have refused to return liberties to common people and have only intensified their assault on the unalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. Healthcare, the right to one's own body, a living wage allowing one to own a house.

**2. Polarization, hate, and violence are on the rise.**

The 2024 presidential campaign started on January 20, 2021 at 12:00. [White supremacy is now mainstream.](http://archive.vn/INs2W)^4

**3. Access to information is limited.**

An information silo is a business management term for information that is self-contained and walled off from everything else. I'm not getting into business jargon here, so think of it like a grain silo. Yes, that giant tube with a dome on top next to a barn. It's full of grain and on the top you can even stand on it (don't do that). It looks good, sturdy, stable, just like a new theory you are exposed to. But if you start poking around, there are a lot of holes, cavities, voids. If one of those collapses, then you go down. You go down and you're done. Just like that. Or maybe you get chest deep, but then you're still stuck. All of the grain, the little bits of theory, the information is so much pressure on you that can't get out. You can't pull yourself out and people can see you but they can't really help either. If you are thrown a rope and enough people try, then may they pull you out. However, the forces of grain on your body may crush you anyway in the process. The way out takes professional help; someone with the proper tools to build blockers around you, so that the pressure is gone and they can safely move you out.

We have tens of millions of the US population living in alternates realities. These thousands of grains of conspiracy theories and actual foreign propaganda are stuck together through lies and gaslighting, or what is now cutely called ""misinformation"". It has become profitable to keep people in these information silos. [Reddit is about to IPO.](http://archive.vn/Hmoc5)^5 That means that like Facebook and YouTube, it will be flooded with ""fact checkers"" and censures and guidance to keep what is on it appropriate for capital inventors and advertisers.

**4. The behavior of people in the know.**

This is what people are noticing now. People who study extremism saw the writing on the wall at end of 2020. The rest of the country saw it in January 2021. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, took action after the 6th to mitigate the risks of a further self-coup. He even [put out a memo on Jan 12th stating his actions.](http://archive.vn/YFzrL)^6 The people paying attention are [seeing the pattern for what it is.](http://archive.vn/CLaep)^7

## Americanisms

The US will be facing a constitutional crisis. We witnessed a practice violent coup on Jan 6. In a different century, when another angry charismatic man did this, he was barely punished at all and then returned 10 years later with a successful political coup. The political coup is going on right now, in the states of Georgia, Michigan, and Arizona. If the results of the primaries go a certain way, that movement will be re-energized. The coup has not failed yet. It has not stopped.

The US has already fulfilled the 14 points of a certain mode of government. That's old news. The ~~Sturmabteilung~~ Proud Boys (even in their neutered state), the Three Percenters, and the Oath Keepers have no shortage of [able-bodied, reactionary men.](http://archive.vn/0CoEw)^8 

The US is heavily divided through manufactured hatred. It is the tried and true method of divide-and-conquer used to kill a nation. The Germans did it to Namibia. The Dutch did it to South Africa. The Belgians did it to Rwanda. The Brits did it to Afghanistan. Reagan funded it in Yugoslavia. And now it's happening here.

In the scenario that things become kinetic, it is not going to end fast. Every enemy nation and their dog will be doing their damnest to keep the USA in conflict and de-stabilized for as long as possible. And every country that is not an open enemy will be doing their damnest to direct proxy battles and make sure that the power vacuum does not re-fill in the wrong way. There are thousands of reasons to be worried about the most powerful arsenal in human history. The US is far bigger than Germany or Yugoslavia. When it falls, the entire world will suffer.

## Frequently Awful Takes

> It won't happen because no one really wants it to.

The majority of people never want to go to war with their neighbors. Yet history has shown us that all it takes is an extreme vocal minority and a pathetic majority for these things to happen. And when it does happen, people who really don't want to choose are forced to choose. 

> Will it be a declared war or an undeclared war?

It is guerrilla warfare with a growing police state. No opposing forces are going to announce themselves to the public and arrange in neat battle positions.

> The police will protect us.

Historically, cops protect right-wing militias, join right-wing militias, and/or operate as their own ad hoc force in service to whatever charismatic figure promises ""law and order"". Police are people and they will protect their own families before they protect yours.

> My favorite governor/senator/millionaire will protect us.

They will be in their wealthy enclave with their private security forces or in their retreat in New Zealand, or Alaska, or with their money in Panama, Dubai, Monaco, Switzerland, or the Cayman Islands.

> We'll just run away to Canada/Mexico. 

American refugees from climate crises (just within the country) are already predicted to be tens of millions. If things turn kinetic, multiply that by 3. Illegal immigration is not suddenly okay when you try to do it. If your next plan is to hide out in the woods, that's the same plan as a million other people.

> The military will stop it immediately.

First, the military is an apolitical institution. The best scenario is that they don't do anything and remain an institution, ensuring their legitimacy. Second, [soldiers are not apolitical.](http://archive.vn/1CSrN)^9 If a Myanmar scenario occurs, they are likely to fracture when they have to start kicking in doors and bombing population centers that look like their own. That's an increase in militia forces. The upper brass has their own leanings as well. Third, it took about 25,000 soldiers to lock down a square mile of DC for a month after Jan 6. Do the math. The USA is too big for the military to effectively subdue a warring population.

> Civilians aren't armed enough to fight the military!

There are over 400 million guns in this country and a population of about 330 million. And military firearms, actual assault rifles, [go missing all the time.](http://archive.vn/OOZyi)^10 [So do the explosives.](http://archive.vn/7lZdf)^11

> Rednecks with guns can't stop drones!

Drones and tanks exist to perform specific tasks. They are excellent in the conventional format of war between nations. They're not so great against a guerrilla force of maybe 50 million+. A drone can't hold a street corner. Tanks are only as good as their supply chain of fuel. Like we saw in Afghanistan, and what Ethiopia is seeing against Tigray right now; even with all of your fancy weapon systems and national backers, if you are massively outnumbered in asymmetrical warfare then it is just a matter of time. Besides, while a drone pilot may operate out of a secure bunker in Hawaii, they have a family that lives in a city or town like everyone else. It's a dark thing to think about.
