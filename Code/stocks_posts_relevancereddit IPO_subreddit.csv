0,Negativity around Reddit's IPO is loaded with bias.,37,rho3z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rho3z0/negativity_around_reddits_ipo_is_loaded_with_bias/,134,1639651006.0,"It's very similar bias to what a Chicago native will speak on Portillos being a public company - they feel so at home with the product that they feel comfortable critiquing it, despite being a regular customer.

I study Metaverse and social media investments and am greatly looking forward to Reddit's IPO.


In my view, the future of Reddit is going to be deeper focus in it's subreddit communities. The CEO is on record saying it looks up to Roblox's community model of game creators (subreddit owners) and players (posts/comments)


In my view, Reddit going public isn't going to be some advertising nightmare for consumers. That part happened years ago when Reddit focused on mobile. Reddit is going to focus on content creation and getting subreddits more active with incentives.

For example, Roblox has engagement based payouts for games, where the creator is paid based on time spent in a game. How much of your time on Reddit is spent on a few subreddits?

I'm also fascinated with how much redditors are willing to spend on digital goods on this app. I think we will soon see a Reddit marketplace that we aren't really expecting too.



I'm really excited for this and Im going all in along with Block for 2022."
1,Reddit monetization after IPO,114,rkfjmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rkfjmx/reddit_monetization_after_ipo/,77,1639977765.0,"Hi all,

Something I've been thinking about lately is Reddit going Public. 

A big reason companies IPO is to cash out or sellout to become billionaires*.  Usually the company grows and becomes worth a lot more, however the platform changes dramatically.  The once private company, then focuses on the balance sheet and pinches pennies and pushes revenue boosting tactics.  

Take Facebook or YouTube as an example.  Facebook was a decent social networking platform before they became public.  Also, didn't use predatorial tactics to keep our attention before.  I remember when I could watch videos on YouTube for hours... Now google wants to show us videos they want us to watch.  

I've watched Reddit also change the past couple years. 

I'm disappointed like your dads disappointment.  

Reddit is going to change, and it's not going to be the better.   They are Sellouts.  You will see ads on top of ads and features be restricted/ removed. 

An alternative of Reddit will surface, I will be waiting...."
2,Reddit Files Confidentially for IPO Social media company says in blog post it filed paperwork with SEC to go public.,12,rhli2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rhli2j/reddit_files_confidentially_for_ipo_social_media/,24,1639639616.0,"Most recently, the company announced that it had raised a $700 million round in August 2021 at a valuation of more than $10 billion. The social media company did not make the filing publicly available. The company also did not say how many shares would be offered nor the price range for the proposed offering.

Although Reddit was created in 2005, it has taken a unique road toward going public.

Conde Nast Publications acquired Reddit in 2006. The social media services remained a part of the publication company until it was made an independent subsidiary in 2011. Since then, it raised a series of funding rounds from venture capital firms. 

Reddit Inc. is considering ways to make its share offering more accessible to individual investors as it plans to go public, Chief Executive Steve Huffman said.

Mr. Huffman the market is evolving in a way that makes it easier for even small investors to buy into new offerings, he said at The Wall Street Journal’s Tech Live conference Monday. It is often difficult for individual investors to buy into hot initial public offerings. “I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our shareholders to be users,” Mr. Huffman said at the conference, which the Journal hosted virtually with top executives."
3,Question on options I was granted by my employer,16,rlhfes,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rlhfes/question_on_options_i_was_granted_by_my_employer/,22,1640101694.0,"I work for a startup and we expect to go public in either 2024 or 2025.

Recently, I was awarded 257 options with a strike price of $12.77.

How can I find out how much that will be worth at our IPO? For example, what is the overall value if our stock price is $100? $150?

Please explain how you arrive at your answer. Thank you!

For context, I received a job offer with less equity but a higher salary and I'd like to understand my current compensation before deciding whether to leave."

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 17, 2021**

Stocks extended Thursday’s losses, with the market ending a volatile week in the red as market participants continued to digest ongoing risk surrounding the Omicron variant and the Fed’s new monetary policy, which signaled a faster rate of taper and interest rate hikes next year. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.02%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.50%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.42%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.92% 
* Volatility Index: +3.19%
* JP Morgan (JPM): -2.28%
* Oracle (ORCL): -6.39%
* AMC: +19.22%
* FedEx (FDX): 4.95%
* Rivian (RIVN): -10.26%

The main focus of market participants remains on the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision, with the Central Bank doubling the pace of tapering and suggestions that the interest rate may be raised three times in 2022.

The potential for higher rates continues to weigh heavily on technology and growth stocks whose valuations rely heavily on future earnings potential. In the last month, the Nasdaq has fallen by -3.43% and the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 8.32% in the last month.

On the other hand, cyclical stocks in the energy and financials sectors outperformed on Thursday, with the prospects of higher interest rates and stronger growth seen as benefiting these sectors. The Dow Jones (DIA) has only lost -1.23% in the month and has been trending upwards in December. As always, it’s important to balance a portfolio with both growth and value stocks.

Troy Gayeski, Chief Market Strategist at F5 Investments, said “The thing investors have to understand is, we're going through a major transition in monetary policy. The Fed has been running emergency policies arguably far longer than they should have been, and as that money supply growth slows down as they ease off the balance sheet expansion and ultimately hike next year, one would at least expect more volatility in markets. And that's really what we've been seeing the last month."" 

**Highlights** 

* The Biden administration on Friday recommended the Federal Communications Commission grant Alphabet's Google and Facebook-parent Meta licenses for an undersea cable.
* The companies entered into national security agreements to protect data on the Pacific Light Cable Network system, an undersea fiber optic cable system that will connect the United States, Taiwan and the Philippines.
* Tesla Inc was hit by a lawsuit over CEO Elon Musk's social media posts including his Twitter poll on stock sales that pulled down its stock prices. Investor David Wagner called for access to internal documents to investigate whether Tesla and Musk failed to adhere to fiduciary duties
* Rivian stock gapped down another roughly 11%  after the company reported earnings that showed steep losses and said it expects to fall “a few hundred vehicles short of its 1,200 production target for this year.
* Alibaba Deputy CFO Toby Xu, making his first major public remarks since being named this month to take over as CFO, said that international e-commerce ""will become one of the key growth drivers"", adding that 57% of revenue for Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics unit, comes from overseas.
* Reddit announced it was filing for an IPO with an estimated $15 billion valuation. I love the platform but I think they’ll have a hard time monetizing users.
* Rivian also announced it was planning to build a new factory in Georgia in order to boost production
* Kellogg’s has reached a new tentative agreement with its 1,400 striking cereal plant workers that could bring an end to the strike that began Oct. 5."

# [Stock futures little changed after the Dow notches a record close](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mixed in early morning trading Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a record close the previous day as investors flocked to shares that stand to benefit from an economic recovery.
*****
> Futures on the blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 were flat, while Nasdaq 100 futures moved 0.3% lower.
*****
> Early losers included Dow component Salesforce, which fell more than 2% in premarket trading following a downgrade from UBS, which also cut Adobe, sending its shares down 1.8%.
*****
> Markets also faced pressure from stocks associated with the economic reopening: Wynn Resorts fell 2%, while Las Vegas Sands was off 1.5%. With Covid cases rising, pharma companies were under pressure, with Regeneron down 3% following a downgrade from Bank of America.
*****
> The moves come as investors look for clues on where the economy stood heading into the new year.
*****
> ADP will be out with its monthly private payrolls count at 8:15 a.m., with the Dow Jones estimate at 375,000 for December. That report will come ahead of Friday’s more closely watched nonfarm payrolls count, which is expected to show a gain of 422,000.
*****
> Investors also awaited the release of minutes from the December Federal Reserve meeting. Policymakers decided then to accelerate the pace of the monthly bond buying taper and indicated that three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes are coming in 2022. They also adjusted their outlook on inflation and economic growth.
*****
> However, the market will be looking for additional information on where officials see policy heading, particularly on what will happen with the Fed’s nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
> On Tuesday, while the Dow climbed 200 points to a new high, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite suffered a sell-off, down 1.3%, amid a rapid rise in Treasury yields. The closely-watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was as high as 1.71% Tuesday, triggering selling in growth-oriented technology stocks.
*****
> Megacap tech stocks underperformed the S&P 500 Tuesday as “investors reconsidered the value of such long-duration assets in the wake of higher rates,” Chris Hussey, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said in a note.
*****
> “The Fed is accelerating its removal of liquidity because inflation has broadened, which has the potential to push 10-year yields higher,” Ed Al-Hussainy, senior rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle, said in a note. “But the central bank must be careful not to act too aggressively, which could derail the economic recovery and cause a recession.”
*****
> Wall Street strategists are expecting a bumpier road ahead for the stock market as the Fed begins to tighten its ultra-easy monetary policy. The median year-end target for the S&P 500 now stands at 5,050, only a 5% gain from Tuesday’s close of 4,793.54, according to CNBC’s Strategist Survey.

# [Dow futures nudge higher after Wednesday’s Fed-induced sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Dow futures edged higher in early trading Thursday, recovering after worries over tighter monetary policy led to the first losing regular trading session of the year.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 104 points, or 0.29%. S&P 500 futures were little changed and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.37%.
*****
> Energy shares helped boost the market in early action as crude prices rose 1.5%. Marathon Oil gained 2.6%, Occidental Petroleum was up 2.2% and ExxonMobil rose 1.3%.
*****
> Rate-sensitive stocks also were higher a day after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting revealed the central bank is getting ready to remove its economic help more more quickly than anticipated. Officials discussed reducing the Fed’s balance sheet in another move to dial back its pandemic-era easy monetary policy.
*****
> Bank of America saw its shares increase 1.5% premarket and Citigroup rose 1.4% and Wells Fargo gained 1.3%.
*****
> The Fed’s plan to reduce the number of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities it holds comes as it is already tapering its bond purchases and is set to hike interest rates after the taper concludes.
*****
> “Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate,” the minutes stated.
*****
> Stocks slid following the release of the minutes. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 392.54 points, or 1.07%, lower after hitting an intraday record earlier in the session. The S&P 500 fell 1.94%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw its biggest one-day loss since February, losing 3.34%.
*****
> The Fed update also pushed the 10-year yield to above 1.75%. It ended last year at 1.51%.
*****
> “If you ride a wave of liquidity to the upside and that liquidity starts to go away, I don’t think it’s terribly surprising that you’re going to see a reaction,” said Kathy Jones, head of fixed income at Charles Schwab.
*****
> “This was the year we were going to transition from extremely easy monetary policy and fiscal policy to less easy monetary and less expansive fiscal policy. That has to have some impact on risk assets that have risen because the discount rate was so low,” Jones added.
*****
> All 11 S&P 500 sectors fell in Wednesday’s session.
*****
> Elsewhere Thursday, shares of Allbirds rallied more than 4% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the shoe brand, whose stock has struggled since it went public in November.
*****
> Investors await quarterly earnings reports from Walgreens Boots Alliance and Bed Bath & Beyond before the bell Thursday.
*****
> On the data front, the weekly jobless claims report is slated for released Thursday morning. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect that claims totaled 195,000 for the week ended Jan. 1. Trade balance data is also due, with economists looking for the deficit in goods and services to total $81.5 billion.
*****
> The releases come a day ahead of the Labor Department’s key nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show that the economy added 422,000 jobs in December. However, payroll processing firm ADP reported Wednesday that companies added a much higher-than-expected 807,000 positions for the month, indicating a possible upside surprise to Friday’s count from the department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.

# [Stock futures turn higher after the S&P 500 hits another record](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/27/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
> U.S. stocks were poised to build on record highs in the final week of the year as futures rose Tuesday morning.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added about 90 points, while those for the S&P 500 gained 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 were up 0.5%.
*****
> The move in futures comes after stocks rallied in Monday’s regular session, with the S&P 500 rising roughly 1.4% to close at a record high. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4%, while the Dow climbed about 352 points.
*****
> Markets continued to look to pandemic news for direction.
*****
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Monday that it was shortening its isolation recommendation for people who test positive to five days from 10, if those people do not have symptoms.
*****
> Research out of South Africa also indicated that omicron infections can help boost immunity to the earlier delta strain of Covid.
*****
> Pharmaceutical stocks dipped in early trading following the relatively optimistic news on the pandemic. Moderna slipped 1.6% and Pfizer was marginally lower in light premarket trading Tuesday morning.
*****
> Stocks dipped in late November, in part because of the rise of the omicron variant of Covid-19, but have since rebounded as governments have largely shied away from reinstating lockdowns and strict social distancing measures.
*****
> Airline stocks did struggle on Monday, however, as the spread of the virus led to hundreds of flight cancelations around the Christmas holiday. Apple also announced that it was closing its New York City stores to customers due to the spike in Covid cases.
*****
> Stocks tend to rise in light trading during the final days of the year, often called the “Santa Claus rally.” However, many Wall Street pros predict relatively small gains for stocks in 2022 after two strong years.
*****
> “If you look around Wall Street, you see very tame expectations, and it’s probably a reflection that we’re probably pretty late in the cycle,” Jim Lacamp, senior vice president at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said on “Closing Bell.”
*****
> In addition to the S&P 500′s record close, the Dow is within 1% of its intraday all-time high, while the Nasdaq is about 2% below its high-water mark.
*****
> For the year, the S&P 500 is up 27.6% for the year and the Nasdaq is up 23.1%. The Dow is the laggard, up 18.6%.
*****
> It is a slow week overall for economic data, but investors will get a look at home prices on Tuesday when the October reading for the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index is released before the bell.

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose sharply in early Thursday trading after the Federal Reserve signaled it would be aggressive on tapering and sees three interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped about 222 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.7% each.
*****
> Shares of companies that have done well in previous rate-hiking cycles led premarket gainers. Materials stocks FMC Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan both rose more than 3% ahead of the opening bell. Bank stocks also rose across the board, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America all up about 0.6%.
*****
> In transportation news, Delta Air Lines reported that it now expects to see a profit of $200 million in the fourth quarter, after previously projecting a loss. Shares rose 2.2% on the news.
*****
> In other central banking news, the Bank of England announced it is hiking its key policy rate by 15 basis points to 0.25%. Markets were awaiting a separate policy decision from the European Central Bank. There also is more economic news on tap, with weekly jobless claims and housing starts out at 8:30 a.m. ET.
*****
> Following the Fed news, traders accelerated their own expectations for interest rate increases. Fed funds futures trading now points to a 63% chance of the first quarter-percentage-point increase coming in May 2022, with chances also rising to about 44% that the central bank could make its first move as soon as March, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
*****
> Stocks traded in negative territory throughout the regular session Wednesday and turned higher ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference in the afternoon at the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Dow added 383 points, or 1.08%. The S&P 500 rose 1.63% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.15%.
*****
> “The fact that the FOMC acknowledged new COVID variants as a threat to the economic recovery that could alter policy going forward, as well as the generally optimistic tone from Powell in the presser, helped spark a relief rally as the Fed meeting was viewed as being not-as-hawkish-as-feared,” Tom Essaye of the Sevens Report said in a note on Thursday.
*****
> The Fed will begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases in January and buy just $60 billion of bonds each month going forward, compared to $90 billion in the month of December. That decision follows recent inflation data showing a 6.8% surge in November, which is higher than expected and the fastest rate since 1982.
*****
> “The notion that elevated inflation levels would be transitory has finally been thrown out the window by the Fed and the latest policy adjustments are reflective of a committee that doesn’t want to miss the next train leaving the station,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
*****
> Health-care stocks UnitedHealth and Amgen gained ground Wednesday, rising 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively.
*****
> Adobe and Accenture are scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the opening bell. FedEx and Rivian will report after the bell.

# [Stock futures slip lower ahead of key inflation data, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures were marginally lower during morning trading Tuesday after the major averages started the week in the red as Covid omicron fears hit sentiment.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 futures declined 0.13% while and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by nearly 0.5%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced between gains and losses.
*****
> Tesla shares were among the biggest early droppers on the S&P 500, falling 2.3% premarket after CEO Elon Musk announced that that he has sold another $906.5 million in shares.
*****
> Fellow automaker Ford also fell, down 2.2% following news that by 2030 Toyota would be investing $35 billion into battery-powered electronic vehicles, a space where Ford has sought to establish itself as a leader. Toyota itself declined even more, with shares off 3.4% premarket.
*****
> Pfizer shares rose nearly 1% after final results of tests on its Covid drug showed it reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 89% in high-risk patients.
*****
> The market will get fresh inflation data Tuesday when November’s producer price index number is reported. Economists are expecting it to show that prices rose 0.5% for the month, according to estimates from Dow Jones. This would be a slight slowdown from October’s 0.6% increase.
*****
> The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.
*****
> Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday that he thinks the central bank should start raising rates soon.
*****
> “The Federal Reserve would be better off storing away some of rate increases, so when the inevitable turn down comes, you’ve got some ammunition to fight with,” he said. “At the moment, at zero interest rates, we have no ammunition.”
*****
> Investors will be watching closely for commentary around if the Fed plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank’s asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.
*****
> “So far the bond market has given the Fed a pass on inflation — whether it will continue to do so is in doubt,” noted Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. “The real fireworks coming from the meeting are likely to be around expectations for rate hikes in 2022,” he added.
*****
> The latest CNBC Fed Survey showed that investment professionals and economists expect the Fed to wind down its asset purchases by March and begin rate hikes in June.
*****
> During trading Monday, the Dow slid 0.89%, or 320 points, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.39% as investors rotated out of technology stocks with high valuations.
*****
> Shares of airlines and cruise line operators declined amid fears that the omicron variant could slow travel.
*****
> While equities fell broadly on Monday, growth areas of the market underperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF dipped 1.22%, while the iShares Russell 1,000 Value ETF declined 0.45%.
*****
> Despite Monday’s decline for equities, the S&P 500 is roughly 1.6% below its Nov. 22 all-time intraday high. The Dow is 2.5% below its record, while the Nasdaq Composite is about 5% under its high-water mark. The Russell 2000 index is down a sharper 11.3% since its Nov. 8 high.
*****
> Looking forward, some strategists, including LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick, believe there’s upside ahead for equities.
*****
> “We believe pent-up demand, gradual improvement in supply chain challenges, solid labor force growth, and productivity gains will all contribute to another year of above-trend economic growth in 2022,” he wrote in a note to clients. “COVID-19-related risks remain and the potential for a policy mistake may be elevated as the economy moves towards normalization, but we think the overall environment will be supportive of business growth and ultimately equity markets,” he added.

# [Stock futures are little changed ahead of key Fed decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-key-fed-decision-.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were little changed in early morning trading on Wednesday as investors readied for Wednesday’s highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision.
*****
> Dow futures gained 8 points. S&P 500 futures were flat, and the Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%.
*****
> The Fed will conclude its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and the public will hear from central bank Chairman Jerome Powell at a 2:30 p.m. ET news conference.
*****
> The Fed is grappling with the highest inflation level in 39 years and the central bank is widely expected to announce an acceleration of the tapering of its bond-buying program, which was put in place during the pandemic to prop up the economy.
*****
> “Investors remain on a buyers strike in front of the FOMC meeting,” Fundstrat’s Tom Lee wrote in a note. “Tapering is not the ‘hawkish pivot’ that ends bull markets, but it is a hawkish pivot relative to the massive easing since the pandemic started. So we think this buyers strike in front of FOMC could turn into a ‘buy the event.’”
*****
> This sets the stage for a dramatic policy shift that will clear the way for a first interest rate hike next year.
*****
> A CNBC Fed Survey predicts the Fed will double the pace of the taper to $30 billion at its December meeting, which would end the $120 billion in monthly asset purchases by about March. The central bank will then hike rates three times in each of the next two years, starting in June 2022, the survey respondents predict.
*****
> “While the chairman is not likely to suggest any specific timeframe for when the funds rate will begin to be lifted, he probably will confirm that some members do want to move more quickly than previously announced in raising interest rates,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.
*****
> “I would not expect the Fed to say much that is not already anticipated by the financial markets,” Paulsen added. “Some of the recent stock market volatility may lessen after this two-day meeting and its press conference is finally concluded.”
*****
> On the political front, congressional Democrats passed a bill raising the debt ceiling, sending it to President Joe Biden early Wednesday just under the wire for when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government would run out of spending power.
*****
> On Tuesday, the major averages slipped, exacerbated by selling in software names like Microsoft and Adobe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 106 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.75%.
*****

Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday, December 13th, 2021-

*****

# [S&P 500 looks set to add to its record close from Friday with futures higher](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> S&P 500 futures rose early Monday after the index notched its best week since February at a fresh record close, rebounding from a big sell-off triggered by fears of the omicron coronavirus variant.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded 40 points higher, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures inched up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.34%.
*****
> Moderna shares were among the strongest gainers premarket Monday, rising 2.4% a day after the White House’s top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci called Covid booster shots “optimal care,” but said the definition of fully vaccinated would not change.
*****
> Elsewhere, Apple moved closer in its quest to become the market’s first $3 trillion company, gaining 1% premarket following an upgrade from JP Morgan.
*****
> Also, chipmaker Nvidia, which has become a signature reopening trade, was up 1.7% on optimism that omicron would not be as disruptive as initially thought.
*****
> The early Monday action followed a strong week on Wall Street as investors shrugged off a hot inflation reading. The blue-chip Dow gained 4% last week, breaking a four-week losing streak with its best weekly performance since March. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively, last week, both posting their best weekly performance since early February.
*****
> Investors digested a jump in headline inflation data, which came in at 6.8% in November year-over-year for the biggest surge since 1982. The print was marginally higher than the 6.7% Dow Jones estimate.
*****
> “The fact is that inflation is likely to remain on the higher side for a while and risks of sticky inflation remain, although we believe that the passing of base effects and the easing of supply chain constraints by the end of the first quarter of next year should slowly bring inflation down to more comfortable levels,” Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in a note.
*****
> The key inflation reading came ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting this week where the policymakers are expected to discuss speeding up the end of its bond-buying program.
*****
> Fed Chair Jerome Powell, as well as a parade of Fed speakers, all recently suggested the central bank could end the $120 billion monthly bond purchase program sooner than the current timeline of June 2022.
*****
> “We believe markets can continue take a higher inflation reading in their stride, though additional volatility remains a risk. With Fed policy staying relatively accommodative, the backdrop for equities is still positive, and we favor winners from global growth,” said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer of UBS Global Wealth Management.
*****
> Stocks bounced back last week as investors bet that the initial worry about the Covid strain is overblown. Many also took solace in the news from Pfizer and BioNTech that a study found three doses of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the variant.
*****
> As of Sunday, the U.S. was approaching 800,000 coronavirus-related deaths. The new variant has pushed some government officials to reinstate health restrictions to slow the spread.

*****
> The U.S. has reported more than 52 million total cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Driving the surge is the omicron variant, which took over as the dominant strain earlier this month.
*****
> A slew of economic data on Thursday last week showed a stable economy with improving labor and spending trends, but inflation at high levels. The Federal Reserve’s closely watched core personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.6% in November from the month prior. Core PCE rose 4.7% year-over-year in November, higher than the 4.5% rate expected.
