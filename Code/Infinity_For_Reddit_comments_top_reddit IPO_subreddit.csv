0,hp5dz3t,t3_rjqmdx,Wait. I'm not well informed about this. What does going public means? :(,t3_rjqmdx,7,Infinity_For_Reddit
1,hp658zr,t3_rjqmdx,"Not yet. But eventually? Their api will probably change, maybe to a paid model.

They're trying to introduce proprietary features like chat and rpan that don't get loaded into the API, and that just makes the unofficial apps better, and the main site worse.",t3_rjqmdx,4,Infinity_For_Reddit
2,hp5xwe8,t3_rjqmdx,"I'm hoping they fully open up the platform, including chat.",t3_rjqmdx,4,Infinity_For_Reddit
3,hpovbev,t3_rjqmdx,Well I think they will continue support 3rd-party apps. But who knows.,t3_rjqmdx,1,Infinity_For_Reddit

5,hpa79ag,t1_hp658zr,I agree. I think it's going to be freemium.,t3_rjqmdx,2,Infinity_For_Reddit
6,hph7zfv,t1_hp658zr,"*They're trying to introduce proprietary features?*

They already have. Rpan, chat/dms, polls, reddit recap, etc are already inaccessible unless you're in the official app or on new reddit. 

An IPO will only cause more features to be dropped. My pessimistic guess though is reddit will shut down the public API and old reddit to force users onto their official app /new reddit if they do go public. Insane backlash on all platforms won't persuade the money from investors.",t3_rjqmdx,1,Infinity_For_Reddit
7,hp65d4s,t1_hp5xwe8,"They won't. Chat is a third party service they *pay for*. Every reddit chat message you send, reddit pays some shitty company that can't write software to save its life. They won't pay to extend that service via API, the whole point is that they're pressuring you to use the official app.",t3_rjqmdx,5,Infinity_For_Reddit
8,hp5o1g1,t1_hp5el4q,Wow thanks. Much appreciated,t3_rjqmdx,3,Infinity_For_Reddit
9,hpn5x9r,t1_hph7zfv,"When I say they're trying to, I mean, their plan for making the official site and official app better than the API-enabled services is to keep introducing these proprietary features until Reddit Sync looks bad. That's their strategy, and it's backfiring because their prorpietary features suck ass.",t3_rjqmdx,1,Infinity_For_Reddit
10,hpcp9ev,t1_hp65d4s,"Honestly nowadays reddit is just ruining itself. They're trying to be *hip and cool* a little too hard in my opinion. No, we didn't need the avatars, we didn't need the NFT avatars. No, we didn't need the ""decentralized"" blockchain bullshit. They're also, just like you said, adding new features only available in their shitty official app. I think RPAN was the last good thing they ever made (excluding awards (dude nobody cares about that sticker that cost you 5 bucks and gave some person 20 MeaninglessInternetPoints(tm)) and removing Aaron from the founders page), as RPAN at least had some original ""charm"" to it, this feeling of jank and it running on an old laptop held together with duct tape somewhere. Until they remade their design, that is.

Corporations being corporations, I guess.",t3_rjqmdx,1,Infinity_For_Reddit
11,hpd3s5o,t1_hpcp9ev,"Wait, they removed Aaron Swartz from the founders page?

WAIT. YOU THINK RPAN WAS GOOD?",t3_rjqmdx,1,Infinity_For_Reddit
12,hpenpry,t1_hpd3s5o,"Yeah, they totally did. Go [here](https://www.redditinc.com/), scroll down to the ""Reddit Founders"" heading. Aaron nowhere to be seen.

RPAN was sorta good. Not much going on there tho.",t3_rjqmdx,1,Infinity_For_Reddit
13,hpf1lu7,t1_hpenpry,"I am mostly offended at the way they pushed RPAN.

It's a totally separate product from reddit. If they had made a new website, linked it to your reddit account, shared it in /r/announcements, and advertised the hell out of it, I might have been intrigued.

But instead, they shoehorned it into reddit. There's a button up near the top of your reddit UI that pulls up a product that *just doesn't work like reddit*. It was shoehorned into everybody's feed, and it looked like a post or an ad, but it wasn't, and you couldn't vote on it, and you couldn't unsubscribe from it, it was just there. And they released it without an announcement explaining wtf it was. IDK what it is, at this point, all I know that it's not actually part of reddit, it's just stuffed in.",t3_rjqmdx,1,Infinity_For_Reddit
14,hpfncej,t1_hpf1lu7,"To be fair I have to agree, they did push it too hard. By the way, neither the button or the posts show up in the old UI.",t3_rjqmdx,1,Infinity_For_Reddit
15,hpfs0i3,t1_hpfncej,"I saw the posts for a while in the old UI. But it's kind of ridiculous that Reddit, by excluding bad features from the old UI / API, is actively selling me on them, and pushing me away from the new UI / official app. (I wasn't really considering the official app at any point).

Oh! The new notification shade is slow as hell and super buggy. Yet another reason.",t3_rjqmdx,2,Infinity_For_Reddit
