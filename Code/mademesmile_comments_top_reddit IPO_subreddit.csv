I stopped drinking alcohol back in July 2018, stayed sober about half a year before starting to drink again for a few months until I realised that moderation is not working. In June 2019 I read that book and stopped again. I never looked back and there wasn‚Äôt a single situation where I doubted my decision or had cravings to drink again. 

The book clears up a lot of subconscious beliefs about alcohol which drastically improves the way you view alcohol. If you can‚Äôt afford the book at the moment then let me know and I will provide a solution for you.

21,hp89am9,t3_rk5aq4,"I gave up drinking several years ago to improve my health. I was not an alcoholic but I could see the negative effects alcohol had on me. 

Until you don‚Äôt drink, you don‚Äôt realize how pervasive alcohol is in our society. Simple things make not drinking really hard. Go to a restaurant and (if they serve alcohol) the beverage menu is often longer than the food menu. First thing the waiter says is, ‚Äúwhat would you like to drink‚Äù and when I say ‚Äúwater,‚Äù I often get the death stare. It is on TV everywhere. New Years Eve is the absolute pinnacle of drinking. Try and go to a NYE party and not drink. It‚Äôs really, really hard and not a lot of fun, many times. 

I don‚Äôt criticize anyone for drinking. I don‚Äôt ever make a big deal of it when I‚Äôm out. But I point this out to show it is REALLY hard to quit drinking and continue to exist as a functioning adult in society. Drinking is not socially acceptable, it is socially expected.

Well I thought at 19 I was at rock bottom but for the next many decades I failed at sobriety over and over. I had sponsors and I did step work and volunteer work and I still couldn‚Äôt stop. I was in and out of psych hospitals and rehabs for many years. Like she says seizures suck and medical detox saved my life over and over.

I tried hypnotherapy, electro convulsive therapy, equine therapy, naltrexone tablets (which I just wouldn‚Äôt take), religion, tried pulling myself up by my bootstraps thinking that success in business would fix it but it just made it worse‚Ä¶ nothing seemed to help until a few years ago when they first offered Vivitrol (injectable naltrexone). It was once a month so it had time to work and didn‚Äôt matter if I was compliant or not.

I was on the injections for over a year before I got to the point of cessation and almost 3 years total. I‚Äôm now a medical cannabis patient and I do psilocybin therapy with my nurse practitioner wife as maintenance treatments and I‚Äôm now 608 days alcohol free.

While I don‚Äôt personally agree 100% with this Ted presenter‚Äôs views on the disease model of AUD (I feel that it eliminates some personal accountability and is often used by us alcoholics to deflect responsibility) it‚Äôs the best we‚Äôve got and thanks to modern medical science I am sober today.

Dax said he was super embarrassed that his friend found out about his addiction, but the friend had seen it in a different light. He saw it as amazing that Dax hadn't given up.

I can say you shouldn't feel guilty or embarrassed and try to go easy on yourself, but I know it's a lot harder than it is to say those things. Like other's have mentioned, one minute at a time, one hour, one day. Try your best not to look too far ahead into the future. As much as you can, ground yourself in the moment. It's okay to feel like you're weak. It's okay to feel like you can't do it. These things are normal. These feelings come along with the human experience.
