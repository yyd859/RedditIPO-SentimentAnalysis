0,We need to start a new site preemptively to avoid reddit IPO censorship.,23,rkeifi,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/rkeifi/we_need_to_start_a_new_site_preemptively_to_avoid/,28,1639974155.0,I am done with reddit.  There is too much 1984 style censorship.  Let's chip in and buy [conspiracy.com](https://conspiracy.com) and make it into a reddit like forum for conspiracies only.

2,My theory of what is really going on. GIVE ME YOUR OPINIONS! If anything we can all make a damn good fiction novel/movie together. ‚ù§,7,rlzjxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/rlzjxx/my_theory_of_what_is_really_going_on_give_me_your/,22,1640156711.0,"I posted this as a response to someone but I figured it would be a good post here, and this community I feel I can relay this to, if no one else.. Thank you for hearing this, could be nonsense, could be cookie crumbs to the greater picture I've theorized. My theory is this, and I've been thinking about it for quite some time though just haven't fine tuned it - like doing real research into connections ü§£ Dont truly believe this to be the case but idk in the most extreme of cases ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A large wealthy group including but certainly not limited to - Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, The Rockefellers, The Kochs, the elites of the CCP, even Elon Musk and his family, Jeffery Epstein, the royal family, the most influential from both sides of politics, the people who own every single ""mainstream"" news station, Anthony Fauci, the churches including scientology, basically all the richest and most influential people in the world are in cahoots and have a plan to inflict the next great reset. Overcoming the next mass extinction by enacting it themselves. Starting with the release of covid and their ""vaccines"". The vaccines over time will cause issues because they aren't actually vaccines but instead alter our DNA and kill everyone who took them over time, slowly, or quickly - yet to be determined. All who are left over will either have all the wealth in the world, or will be those of us who refused to take it due to our distrust in the system, and those in control of it. That will be the last great stand which will inevitably lead to the remainder of us being enslaved, and those who can't be enslaved, will be killed.

I piece this together by the facts that follow: Bill Gates is heavily involved in vaccine research and also buying up as much farm land as possible as well as many other billionaires as an investment. Every news station spitting out the same rhetoric, verbatim. All the while what is actually happening is in general the complete opposite of the news narrative. Covid being used as such a scare tactic when from the beginning it was never all that dangerous to the majority of people. All ""science backed facts"" of which being overturned by the data later on down the road, which is overlooked and downplayed, a narrative always spun by one or more of the above mentioned parties. Vaccines causing more harm than good already, and we're only about a year into their use, just waiting to see what's coming down the pipeline later on. The people being turned against each other because of the fear tactics being spun. This disagreement among even family and friends, forget complete strangers, will tear us apart and prevent us from coming together to face any greater evil at all.

All of that is just the tip of the iceberg imo since I'm just an autistic retard who can't truly piece together all of his thoughts into a coherent storyline. I will probably end up taking time to actually write all of this out and then resubmit I to you folks, so long as reddit isn't completely destroyed by its IPO, or other factors like spam bots. Also, idk if I truly believe this myself, or if it's just my brain taking completely random facts together out of a world that seems to be in flames and trying to gather an explanation for it all. Would love to hear more people add to it, or counter it with logic, but the dismissal of ""conspiracy theories"" and being a nut for coming up with them is what I expect - and would just be further fire into my theory of what will be the next great extinction."
