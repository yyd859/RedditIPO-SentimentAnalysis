Reddit can’t catch everything that quickly as subreddits pop up so things will squeak by until it’s not noted until much later. 

Another user mentioned Twitter didn’t ban porn, but I want to say that Reddit banning porn would be easier since they can just make the subreddit creation process harder and mass ban entire subreddits quite easily compared to Twitter and banning users.

550,hp1pbon,t3_rj5cgx,"I think the real important thing with this IPO is to recognize that reddit exposure for reddit stock will probably create a surge in performance before the eventual downswing in stock Price. Just because logically the IPO may create censorship issues for the users does not mean people wont buy this IPO. So no matter how you feel about it i think it’s foolish to not make money on both ends of this trade. 

EXAMPLE : HOOD. Most reasonable people agree robinhood is a garbage brokerage , but we still know that tons of millenials use it and thus we saw a huge price surge for about 1 week after IPO. Didnt matter that it was a garbage company a bunch of autists still bought the stock. Hedgefunds probably also rode the wave and took advantage of the hype and then sold their shares near the top. I think we see a similar run to Robinhood. 

So in my opinion the move here is to Buy shares at IPO day, ride the wave, lock in gainz and then contemplate a short position or buying puts. Use the whole animal, make money on both sides of the trade.

I also think fundamentally the value to shareholders of buying into an IPO is that you’re giving money to a company to invest in their platform or tech or advertising to increase sales/users/engagement. How would Reddit do these things with our money? How would our money increase future growth/revenue/profits? What technology or growth would investing in them bring? What are they going to do or change in the app and how would that make it add users or profits? Nothing. It’ll be like Twitter stock where a mature (age not content, per se) platform doesn’t show increased users, monetization, or profits.

SPAC's became the go to move for companies (both sketchy and legit) to get into this investor dogpile quickly since its faster than a full IPO.  Now, the market is less bullish and people are moving investments away to less risky stocks. The SPAC craze appears to be slowing also.  

Rivian was probably the last hurrah of the throw money at a tech IPO or SPAC, and everyone saw it tank pretty hard after a huge hype up to 170$

It was declining even before the redesign, but that definitely kicked more people off and then between everything that has happened in the last 5 years it has just devolved into more of a clusterfuck.

————————————————————————

I think they just want to cash out while they can still guarantee a relatively high IPO. 

This is just my opinion, but the IPO market has been insane the past 2 years. Countless companies raising record capital and some being overvalued. I believe the cycle is winding down, and that this is their last chance to get a higher than normal IPO and cash out (at least for the short term). 

Not all of the data below directly relates to Reddit IPO, but they are all intertwined. When the equity market is frothy, SPACS popping off, crypto going bananas, etc, this allows companies to IPO higher. Markets dont like uncertainty. If Russia attacks Ukraine, and lets say threatens European countries to not intervine or they cut their oil/gas (this is all extremely speculative, just trying to create an example) this will have an impact on markets. Could amplify other macro events and markets go lower, then Reddit cannot raise as much at IPO. 

My reasoning:

-	S&P 500 is set to end higher this year for the third year in a row. Analysts predict a rally in 2022, but a four year streak has only happened 5 times in the past century
-	Fed announcing 3 rate hikes for 2022
-	Crypto/NFT mania seems to be cooling off
-	Winter season with Omnicron variant/covid/flu
-	S&P and Nasdaq are heavily weighted and being held up by a few tech giants. Look under the hood at all the other companies and their returns
-	2021 record year for IPOs and SPACs; see below
-	SPAC boom/bust: most SPACs are down since the boom in February. CLOV down 73% YTD, SPCE down 37.7% YTD, OPEN down 40% YTD, SOFI up 20%. ($2.45) YTD
-	Recent IPOs: Coinbase down 29% since IPO, Rivian down 25% since IPO, Bumble down 56% since IPO, Robinhood’s ath after their IPO was $85, is now trading $19.10, Oatly down 64% since IPO, Coursera down 47% since IPO, Lemonade (2020 IPO) down 59% YTD, Beyond (2019 IPO) down 52% YTD, Peloton (2019 IPO) down 71% YTD
-	2020 IPO Upstart Holdings up 216% YTD, but has been on a downtrend since hitting all time high in October. Past 3 months is down 54%. I call this out as an example of frothy, since the clip of someone pumping this on CNBC and couldn’t answer when asked what the company does
-	Oil/Gas issues. When oil went negative in 2020, some refineries and pumps were permanetly closed. CNBC and Bloomberg had oil people on who explained this. You cant just quickly reopen/restart them. US crude oil production is projected to return to 2019 levels in 2023. The amount of crude oil processed at US refineries is projected to return to 2019 levels by 2025. 

As I previously stated, this is all my opinion. I’m a complete amateur. I love this stuff and am trying to become a trader at a firm, but realistically I dont know anything and am probably wrong about a lot. I’ve been wrong countless times in 2020/21.",t3_rj5cgx,2,wallstreetbets

I know quite a few people who have been in the “media” due to their Onlyfans and trust me, OF doesn’t arrange shit lol. In reality, OF SUCKS AS A PLATFORM. There’s way better platform but they all have low traffic. Like there’s no internal promoting system. It’s not like PH where channels are recommended, all the advertising is done by the creator themselves. It’s just the largest platform since celebrities are hosted on there. Most of the top creators on Onlyfans are celebrities and influencers that do not show nudity, OF would have capitalized on that and followed through similar to how Patreon did. Also, Onlyfans lost a huge chunk of paying users leave the platform due to its volatility, and that was predictable. So what does OF get out of that story except losing revenue? And OF is notorious for taking money from creators without a trace, shutting down legitimate pages and so many problems. Many of you all don’t talk to OF girls or sex workers, so there’s a lot of false narrative out there that don’t even make sense when critical thought is applied. And it’s exactly how the religious right wants it to be, so ppl like you, spew misinformation that frames the issue as “Onlyfans bad” instead of realizing that the religious right is censoring your internet content. 

FYI: MasterCard changed their vendor rules in October due to SESTA FOSTA. Onlyfans payment processor changed to ccbill in November, with this change came numerous crackdowns on content, and major content policies updated restricting BDSM content and certain 3rd party content to adhere to their new payment processor rules. Idk about you but it definitely sounds like they planned to get rid of explicit content, saw the backlash, CCBill likely struck a good deal with them, and they reversed their decision.",t3_rj5cgx,27,wallstreetbets
966,hp4bskv,t1_hp46ih8,"You’re mistaken, they originally were going to get rid of all explicit content including penetration, masturbation, or and hardcore acts. When they reversed, their new processor and guidelines of MasterCard is what caused them to get stricter on CNC. Their initial decision was to only allow soft core porn, very similar to what happened to Patreon as they used to allow hardcore stuff on there way back but their payment processor (PayPal) did not want explicit content. OF’s payment processor literally changed in November. Hence why you can now purchase a subscription without “Onlyfans” showing on the statement it is now CCBill, which has stricter guidelines for the sexual content they will process payments for. That’s why kink stuff got restricted. Not because they weren’t planning on banning porn. They very much were planning on banning hardcore stuff, the email they sent is literally all over Twitter. And the amount of users they lost in that time would be antithetical to any subscription based website’s agenda. 

Reddit probably won’t ban porn, I assume they will do what Twitter does and “shadowban” adult content creators from their search bars, and restrict NSFW subreddits from purchasing awards to make sure they aren’t violating SESTA FOSTA. Similar to how sex workers can’t monetize their accounts on Twitter. The current SESTA FOSTA lawsuit against Reddit is actually garbage, but that still means Reddit is on their radar and them going public makes it 10x easier to stir up commotion and scare investors without having to do a lawsuit. There’s lots of stuff going on there.",t3_rj5cgx,7,wallstreetbets

As for « genuinely violent » again depends what you’re referring to, but there were some dissident political subs or even non-political but made comments admins didn’t like that got nuked. 

Reddit used to be a very free speech place, everyone understood that there were subs you didn’t like on the site but that doesn’t mean you take them down, it means you just don’t visit there. Even just having an axe dangling over the head of any subreddit that wants to touch certain topics changes the culture. 

Reddit made an effort to become more palatable to the average user, and in doing so invited the staleness and « safety » that the rest of social media suffers from. 

Even just making it possible for people like that to remain here makes subreddits like r/againsthatesubreddits possible where mods don’t even need to hate a sub to axe it, because those users can just report or false flag any sub out of existence. 

Old users will remember the reaction to the banning of r/fph or r/coontown, people weren’t huge fans of those subs but everyone understood how serious a precedent it was. Now subs getting banned is just part of how the website works, that was unthinkable 10 years ago.

This logic is only valid if you’ve been continuing to buy at this current price. Have you?

Edit: You’re holding because you believe there’s a slight chance the stock might go back up and you can break even. If that’s your belief, wouldn’t it make sense to buy shares at only 50% of your cost basis, so that when it does go back up, you can actually profit?

Also another edit because I post my comments too early:

With this logic, your only other “choice” is to ride it to zero since you won’t sell for a loss. Essentially you’d rather lose everything you invested, or break even.

I would agree with this if mods were extremely neutral, dry, and professional.

Generally, reddit mods don't try to be any of these things.

It's a symbiotic relationship. Mods keep reddit clean for advertisers, and in return get the authority to behave in silly ways. I had a friend who argued with a power mod and was instantly banned from about 150 different subs. Or remember when the old /r/wallstreebets mods came back and hastily attempted to monetize the subreddit? Or remember the big dispute between the reddit admins and power mods over covid-19 discussions?

They're not held to the standards of employees. Really, this is a hobby for them rather than a job. If we started charging them money to continue moderating, they'd pay it. Market it as a $10.00 per month subscription to ""Reddit Premium"".

This sub is actually a great example of the impact of mods. It used to be ""4chan found Bloomberg terminal"". I think you'd be instantly banned for behaving like that now. Now it's more like ""the living embodiment of soijack googled the term 'hedgefund'"".

There is a decent chance I'll be banned for this comment alone, because it's within the prerogative of mods to ban people on whims. It's the price we pay for free moderation.",t3_rmc8rx,2,wallstreetbets

In order to pay mods, Reddit would need very reliable data processes in order to prevent fraudulent payouts for mods just gandering on the app without putting forth a service for the community for a certain alotted time.

I can get a bit obsessive about hobbies and as much as I enjoy trading, I try to remind myself that this is all fun and games -- none of it matters as much as investing time and energy into those I care about.   Balance.

Don't just hold shit to expiration. There are too many that do that and they have nice big red accounts that's completely blown up. You still have 20k. ALSO, your shit out of H00D, come'on. Think longer term too (if you can do leaps), closer to ITM if you can afford it. And, you're up from mutual funds, that's great too.

What do Reddit users think about the Reddit IPO?

Reddit users on the forum r/WallStreetBets have already vocalised their concerns about the move to take the firm public. The main criticism seems to be that as a listed company, Reddit will need to start generating more income to please shareholders, which could result in users seeing more advertising and modifications to the experience.

How much is Reddit worth?

Reddit was valued at $10 billion in a private fundraising round in August 2021, but by the time of its IPO, the online message board company is aiming for a valuation of more than $15 billion.

What does Reddit do?

Reddit is an online discussion board and community, founded in 2005 by Steve Huffman and late activist Aaron Swartz. Despite not being as popular as other social media firms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, Reddit has made its name with niche – and often controversial – discussion groups.

Reddit has more than 100,000 communities, in which over 53 million active daily users share their thoughts and ideas on a range of topics. In fact, Reddit is currently the 19th-most-visited website on the internet, and the sixth-most-popular social networking site.

The site allows users to post anonymously, which is supposed to encourage honestly and transparency. Any post can be voted on by the community; posts with the largest number of up votes are viewed more and hold greater authority.

Most recently, Reddit has become a hub of retail investors, flocking to the board r/WallStreetBets to discuss tips and ideas on stock trading. The community – known as a subreddit – was responsible for the rise of GameStop and other so called ‘meme stocks’. Their intentions were to profit as hedge funds covered their short positions, in what’s known as a short squeeze.

How does Reddit make money?

Reddit makes its money through advertising on its site. It reported that in Q2 2021, it made $100 million in ad revenue – three times the amount it made in Q2 2020.

For users who don’t want ads on their feeds, there is a ‘premium membership’ available, which grants an ad-free experience as well as full access to the r/lounge, 700 free monthly coins, and other benefits. The membership costs $5.99 per month or $49.99 per year.

Reddit also generates money through Reddit Coins, which are virtual goods that Reddit users can purchase in bundles and gift to other Reddit users to reward them for their contributions and good content. Coin bundles cost between $1.99 to $199.99.

Other benefits to users holding Reddit Coins include access to the r/lounge. Which is an exclusive subreddit group for Premium members only.

Reddit has also raised capital through eight rounds of fundraising, generating a total of $919 million from 27 different institutional investors.

Is Reddit profitable?

No, Reddit isn’t yet profitable. In 2020, Reddit reported $170 million in revenue.

What is Reddit's business strategy?

Reddit’s business strategy thus far is a pretty odd one, given that the firm sacrifices the opportunity to make money in order to keep its users happy. As we’ve seen, advertising space sales are the company’s primary revenue stream. However, Reddit does not require email addresses and does not track personal information, losing out on the opportunity to increase advertising through data exploitation, in order to keep its users anonymous.

And this is where one of the biggest challenges Reddit could face comes in: regulation. Due to the anonymity of users, there’s always the possibility of malpractice and manipulation, such as bots or even hedge funds driving users toward certain stocks. Reddit does already have moderators in place, but once it’s a public firm the level of scrutiny it’ll face will likely increase. Any thread to the anonymity of users could cause an exodus from the platform.

After half a decade neglecting its ad platform, Reddit has begun to invest heavily in this area before it goes public, so we may see the company reach profitability by 2022.

Reddit announced in 2020 that it was buying video creation app Dubsmash, entering into direct competition with TikTok.

The company also just hired its first ever chief financial officer, Drew Vollero (previous CFO for SNAP) in what many see as preparation for its IPO.

Who owns Reddit?

Reddit is owned by Condé Nast Publications, a global media company, who bought the company from founders Huffman and Ohanian one year after it was created for $10 to $20 million.

Current investors in Reddit also include Fidelity Investments, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Tencent Holdings.

My expectation is that Reddit will actually invest in communities rather than investing in tech or advertisers as much as people fear. That's the real moat here.

3536,hqqj62n,t3_rt485p,"What I really like about Reddit as opposed to other social media platforms, is that it’s content centric, not user centric. That way it stays clear of all the “influencer” BS/noise.

I’ve deactivated my FB profile years ago (too much of a college student/insecure vibe), but really enjoy scrolling content centric posts on Reddit.

Using the going public valuation, Shaw will already have made 5-10x his investment. Also Reddit probably going to pop even higher on first trade versus IPO price given the interest level.

If their growth was based on more hardware sales I'd jump in.   But I think a lot of their earnings come from trying to increase advertising...  and I hate ads.   People WILL start getting more and more pissed off over time about buying TVs with built-in advertising...   Possibly ticked off enough to start actively seeking out alternatives that do not include ads in an expensive purchase like a new TV.   Roku won't be able to just make ads more intrusive to increase ad revenue without backlash... the negotiations over data mining from users and ad/subscription revenue has already cause some very public issues.
