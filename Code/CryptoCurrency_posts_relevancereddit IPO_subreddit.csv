As you already know, Reddit is preparing to become public company with around 15 Billion Dollar Valuation:

On other side, Reddit is preparing to extend its Cryptocurrency project- Reddit Community Points which launched in May 2020 for 2 subreddits:

https://www.reddit.com/community-points

*It looks like they choose WSB as demonstration in the graphics with Token that looks like Dimond.


If big subreddits gets their own economics and token, this will create value for each subreddit and it can be adding even more value to the current Reddit Valuation or even backing it.


For now there are 2 subreddits with Tokens :
r/Cryptocurrency MOON - $15M MC. 
Fortnite BRICK - $3M Market Cap.

Note that these are on testnet and there should be 0 value for testnet tokens, on mainnet everything will change and we might see serious increase in valuation.

Now think about 10-20 big subreddits with big market valuation on mainnet. Think about it, DogToken or Shiba are valued around 10-30 Billion $ each while whole Reddit valuation is 15 Billion.

What can WSB or r/Cryptocurrency Token bring to the table? Millions of Redditors will involved and it can endup real big Win for Reddit and Redditors.

2,Some additional info regarding Community points such as Moons and the upcoming Reddit IPO and community points usage,7,rk47kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rk47kg/some_additional_info_regarding_community_points/,10,1639943425.0,"Someone posted about a community wanting to buy 51% of Reddit IPO to control it but the reality is this is not necessary. Reddit is actually working on what seems to be a DAO, Decentralised Autonomous Organisation

Reddit are decentralising their own platform by introducing Reddit Community Points to certain subreddits, this is done by tokenizing Karma - each month users gets tokens equivalent to their Karma (Posts and Comments in the subreddit), this number gets reduced by 2.5% each month until all tokens are minted 2035 approximately.

This experiment launched (Beta / Testnet) on May 2020 with rCryptocurrency and rFortnite subreddits being involved (Moons and Bricks).As a community we have been the Beta testers of this for quite some time now. Some of us have made some beautiful unrealised gains with Moons and farming with shitposts. At the moment there are 200k+ unique holders for these Community Points.

Arguably moons have changed the community a lot, whether its for the best or not is up to each individual. I have enjoyed this experiment and have also made some nice profits

[https://www.reddit.com/community-points/documentation/introduction](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/documentation/introduction)

[https://www.reddit.com/community-points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points)

**What is the usage of these points?**

1. Voting Power in Governance Polls that changes the subreddit rules.
2. Tipping between users on Reddit.
3. Buying premium Membership on Reddit.
4. Converting Points to Reddit Tokens.
5. Buying Budgets and items on Reddit.

**What is unique about this?**

True ownership, once you receive the tokens, no one can take them from you or manipulate them, even Reddit themselves. Just like with our moons

Reddit Community Points can be traded like any other tokens! Imagine WSB getting unique tokens for its holders - Like Joseph Lubin said “If you think GME story is wild, wait until Reddit Tokens launch on Mainnet “.

[https://mobile.twitter.com/ethereumjoseph/status/1354589623238930435](https://mobile.twitter.com/ethereumjoseph/status/1354589623238930435)"
3,To all the folks thinking $1 or $2 price for moons is the end goal - you're missing the big picture,32,rpyzmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rpyzmb/to_all_the_folks_thinking_1_or_2_price_for_moons/,282,1640643630.0,"I know, I know, your daily dose of hopium and whatnot.

Just think about it. It had the price $0.4 in August. Without a mainnet, without a use case, without an entity behind them that's going to IPO soon (if you [missed the news](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/reddit-ipo/)). All of those are in the pipeline, and really soon. The price was $0.4, 40% of ""dream price"", with being available only on two smallish swap sites. With daily volume of a few thousand of $. Without anyone (besides people here) knowing about them.

Doge has the marketcap of $25 billion. No one in their right mind would think this is possible just a year ago. It's a joke, for Satoshi's sake. It did not have a whitepaper a week ago. It just started, and against all odds started going up, giving tremendous return to the holders that thought of it as a joke.

Sure, Doge was one of the first meme coins and practically no one can top their meme coin status. Except Shib did just a few weeks/months ago. Of all the meme coins, Shib did it (this makes no sense, but that's a different topic).

So, Moons have a max supply of 250 mill (I'm, for the sake of being on the conservative side, not including the burned tokens and project for the full 250mil, even though not all of them are on the blockchain yet). For them to reach that kind of mcap ($25B), they'd need to have a price of around $100. That's right, over 800x from where it is now.

Insert Keannu ""Woah"" gif, I know. Hear me out, though.

Now, who's to say Moons cannot do that? Even the almighty ETH had a smaller mcap than that during 2018. Which is exactly my point. The total crypto mcap is $2.5 trillion, and topped around $3 trillion this year. When it's growing, it's insane. There is not a single reason why moons cannot do that (that Doge and Shib have not overcome).

If/when Moons get on the mainnet, and if/when they develop a solid use case for them, I don't see a single reason why it could not be at that mcap. Doge and Shib did it without a use case. And without a legal entity behind them, preparing for an IPO. But it's most likely gonna be (sorry for the downer) the next bull run, not this one."
4,Moon buying vs. Moon earning,16,rjt22v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rjt22v/moon_buying_vs_moon_earning/,78,1639905091.0,"Given the recent news about the [Reddit IPO](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/reddit-ipo/) and the potential of moons becoming a utility token/currency to be used Reddit wide as indicated a few months ago, do you think it would be a good idea to go buy up moons or do you think that earning them the usual way (posting, commenting, voting) would be best?

&#x200B;

I know that this question is very subjective and contextual in the sense that it depends on personal circumstance/situations (financial or other). Just interested to know what you guys think. 

&#x200B;

Thanks a lot for your time and feedback, really appreciate it!"
5,We should create a DAO and buy Reddit once it IPOs,3279,rjl893,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rjl893/we_should_create_a_dao_and_buy_reddit_once_it_ipos/,940,1639876127.0,"This idea is a modification of a r/WSB post I saw earlier today. We all know that crypto technology is the future and where better to display this technology than through Reddit. This is a rough idea ( kind of a joke but interesting to think about nonetheless) that I would love the community's input on.

Reddit recently filed a confidential report with the SEC marking its first step toward an IPO. According to Forbes, Reddit's most recent funding round yielded $700 Million, which puts the companies value at around $10 Billion. Most companies offer a limited number of shares at any given time. These shares are usually common stock which gives investors a right to vote and earn dividends (if dividends are offered). The right to vote is the important part. If an individual or group can buy a majority \[ 50% plus 1\] of a company's voting stock, known as a controlling equity interest, then that individual or group has significant influence in the operating decisions of the company. However, a majority is not always required and significant influence can be achieved through owning a plurality of voting shares.

This is where a DAO comes in. I think we all remember the ConstitutionDAO that valiantly tried to buy one of the 13 copies of the U.S Constitution. In what was our crypto National Treasure moment, we were presented with a real-world example of the power of crypto technology. Thousands of individuals, ""The People"", participated to fundraise money and buy a piece of history. A RedditDAO could attempt a similar feat, but instead of buying an artifact, we could buy a controlling share of Reddit. We could all have a voice on the board of a publically traded company. We would be able to influence strategic and operational changes that impact Reddit users (all of us). Instead of being at the whims of management, we could become a part of management.

I neither know the legal behind a DAO having a seat on the board of a publically traded company nor do I know the steps toward creating a DAO, but If someone with the know-how and resources does then this could be an interesting endeavor.

For those of you that didn't labor through the paragraphs above here is the TLDR:

TLDR: We create a RedditDAO to buy a controlling or influencing share of Reddit once it IPOs. With this influence, we not only have a voice in the decisions of the company but protection from potentially harmful policies.

Edit: The level of support for this is outstanding!  I have tried to respond to as many of you as I can. Thank you all for participating in true r/CC fashion. I appreciate the awards, humor, suggestions, and criticisms that have been offered. "

## Christmas Crypto Conversations

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ozhujzsjk7681.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8954a047ccbc32f067b1b9b097fa4ced7f4fe41

It’s a relatively quiet day in the cryptoverse. Price action is slow, and volume is low. It seems things are slowing down for the holidays and is typical around this time of year. People are leaving to visit families, and there is generally less work conducted. Traders and enterprises are also beginning to take profits for the year to either pay taxes or show off gains.

Here is the best thing that can happen to crypto in the coming week or two, and it has nothing to do with price or adoption. [I covered price probabilities yesterday](https://medium.com/@TraderGabi/crypto-market-update-12-16-eoy-bitcoin-price-probabilities-926aa05acfc). All the people going home for Christmas, the executives holding parties and all the friends gathering, will need some interesting new subjects to discuss. I think this year it will be bitcoin, crypto, and buzz topics like NFTs.

Whether it's talked about in a good light or not, the important thing is that the conversation is taking place. Next time the executive is watching CNBC and the bitcoin price shows +6% gain for the day, he'll notice. Once a mother hears her child talking NFTs with a friend, she'll notice. When all the fans enter the former Staples center, soon-to-be Crypto.com center, THEY WILL NOTICE.

Humans are incredibly great at networking. These thoughts about crypto will spread quickly in the mainstream, and once news networks realize the hottest subjects on social media are crypto-related, they'll cater to their customers. My hope for the holidays is that those small dinner discussions on Christmas provide the fuel to help propel crypto into a promising 2022.

&#x200B;

 

## Market Update

&#x200B;

**Bitcoin**  is down **-1.49%** and consolidating. $46.5k is showing signs of support. BTC will come in contact with the downtrend line soon, then it will have to choose to break out or continue lower.  

**Terra (LUNA)** is up **3.27%** as it continues its steady march upwards.

**Harmony One (ONE)** is up +6.32% preceding the launch of its Ethereum bridge scheduled on Monday. So keep an eye on ONE in the coming weeks.

**Polkadot (DOT)** continues to get beat **down -4.38%**, despite the upcoming Parachain launch.

Notable Gainers

* **YEARN +33%**
* **AVAX +10.5%**
* **EWT  +6%**
* **CTX   +46%**

The rest of the market is a relatively mixed bag.

* [The SEC has delayed yet another two Bitcoin Spot ETF proposals for 45 days.](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/17/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscale-and-bitwise-spot-bitcoin-etfs/) This will be the third spot ETF proposal the SEC has pushed back. Nevertheless, there is growing pressure from crypto entities and government officials to allow this style of ETF into the market.
* [The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has realized its annual report noting stablecoins and defi pose a growing risk to the U.S. Financial System.](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/17/financial-stability-group-warns-of-stablecoin-defi-risks-in-annual-report/) If regulation begins coming down on stablecoins, expect decentralized stablecoin demand to rise. [Here is a past report on how to take advantage of this trend](https://medium.com/@TraderGabi/crypto-market-update-and-trading-digest-11-9-27940a93d95c) (Under Terra).
* [Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, is leaving the blockchain in the hands of token holders to focus on crypto legitimization in Latin American countries after witnessing the success of El Salvador](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/17/justin-sun-is-retiring-from-tron-but-not-crypto/).

&#x200B;

 

## Notable Events

**Verox (VRX)** is launching an Andriod App on Monday

**Harmony One (ONE)** is launching a trustless Ethereum bridge on Monday. This is huge news for the layer-1 smart contract platform. ONE has many upgrades scheduled in the near term.

&#x200B;

 

## NEWBIES’ Lesson of the day

**Popular Crypto Abbreviations**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a1uu95zwj7681.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=5329d65adabbd91f752ce6fb73f97717461f7e44

 

There's particular jargon specific to crypto like any other community out there. It's not created to make people feel left out but rather to strengthen community ties. I've mentioned a few of these buzzwords in my newsletter so it's time I introduce the newcomers to some of their meanings.

**HODL** – Not to hold but to HODL. It means to not sell your crypto but to hodl for dear life. Rumor has this it this word was created in 2013 by an early developer of Bitcoin who was drunk while messaging.

**DYOR** – DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. This has been used in the newsletter a few times and is very important. Don’t throw all your trust in my newsletter or Youtube influencer, DYOR.

**FUD** – FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, and DOUBT. We all know news profits off fear at this point. If you make it a habit to keep up with news (I got you!) you begin to see patterns of FUD and then elation. Don't buy into FUD. FUD doesn't mean the news isn't accurate, FUD is just highlighting what is created to stir emotion.

**FOMO** – FEAR OF MISSING OUT. All your friends are going to the beach, but you have to work, FOMO! All your co-workers buy Shiba Inu, and you fear not getting rich with them, FOMO! FOMO is here to remind us that FOMO is a strong emotion.

**DEFI** – Decentralized Finance is any decentralized crypto project that offers financial services. Exchanges, Lending/Borrowing dApps, Yield Farms, and even Stablecoin are forms of DeFI. There are many more.

**DEX** – Decentralized Exchange. A peer-to-peer exchange that does not foster a third party as a middleman. **UNISWAP (UNI)** was the first of its kind in 2020, and now there are more than one hundred.

**REKT** – Short version of WRECKED.  To get REKT means to lose a lot of your funds. If you have a bad trade, you can get REKT.

*Can you think of more popular abbreviations or terms?*

7,Reddits probably going public. And that’s a good thing for us.,4,rhv0wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rhv0wa/reddits_probably_going_public_and_thats_a_good/,40,1639674209.0,"Now before you jump on me, hear me out. 

Traditional social media has been on a decline for years. Anyone who has used Twitter for more than 10 minutes know it’s just a cesspool of negativity. Facebook is even worse. Just a bunch of Karen’s spouting misinformation.

I saw Reddit as the last social media app that was genuinely out for(mostly) censorship resistant content. Well that’s going to change considering they’re preparing to file for an IPO. 

With the recent DAO hype, I think now is the best time for someone to develop a real decentralized social media website. We have the infrastructure to develop a full on, community governed social media website. Use an L2 like Arbitrum to avoid high gas fees when interacting. Create a separate governance token for proposals. We have the tools to do it. 

I realize there are people trying to create decentralized social media websites. The problems with these is that they’re trying to be just a decentralized Twitter. No. That’s not how we win. We need to create something with a fresh new look. A sleek UI, and a genuinely rewarding experience. 

Take Robinhood for example. Sure, they’ve gone to the shitter in recent years. But their original design was pretty revolutionary at the time. They made it extremely easy to interact with stocks as well as options. 

With the Reddit IPO, I don’t see any other solution. When your entire company is run by investors who only care about their bottom line, you lose long term. We need a platform where users aren’t the product."

## The social platform is seeking an initial public offering of common shares, it said in an announcement Wednesday.

 Reddit has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a proposed initial public offering of its common stock, the company announced on Twitter.

* The numbers of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have yet to be determined, the announcement said.
* The IPO is expected to occur after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market conditions.
* Reddit is in a “quiet period,” and for regulatory reasons cannot disclose more information, the announcement said.
* The social media platform announced in January it was expanding its work with the Ethereum Foundation to provide development resources to scaling tools. In the announcement, posted to the Ethereum subreddit, Reddit employee u/jarins said the move increases the company’s commitment to the technology and echoes its long-held “decentralized ethos.”
* Wednesday’s release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation to buy any securities, Reddit said in a disclaimer.

Reddit has filed its IPO documents, which are now under review, Reuters reports (https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/reddit-files-us-ipo-2021-12-16/)

In keeping with the independent spirit that has made Reddit so successful (its nothing without us Redditors), the powers that be should either give us the opportunity to buy pre-IPO shares like the investment bankers or do a fair launch with no pre-sale. 

Not only would they save a ton of banker fees if they sold direct to the community, but they’d avoid a lengthy roadshow/book building process, and stay true to their mission. 

A fair launch (no pre-sale) has also been a successful strategy for many companies. 

Since demand will be so high just from the Reddit community alone they could also restrict access to MOON and BRICK holders. 

So, how do we get in on what promises to be the most oversubscribed IPO launch in modern memory?"
12,How Reddit’s IPO and Expanded Tokenization will affect r/CC,1,rih1pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rih1pq/how_reddits_ipo_and_expanded_tokenization_will/,24,1639746382.0,"First let me preface by saying this is all speculation and anyone who says they know what’s going to happen is a liar (unless they actually know in which case you should listen to them). 

As we all know, not only is crypto volatile, it’s complex and confusing. Sometimes when something seems like a positive catalyst, it’s actually a giant hole in the bottom of the boat. 

But fear not, I am here to help. I have strong reason to believe that Reddit’s IPO and Tokenization will affect our beloved tokens value (note that it is against the rules to trade this token) in one of three ways:

1. Value will increase 

Something will happen that will be good and the value will go up. 

2. Value will decrease 

Unlike option 1, the thing that happens is not good and will actually make the value go not up (i.e. down)

3. Value will stay the same 

It is always possible that many good and not good things will happen that will have no effect at all. Additionally, it’s possible that the total sum of good things is equal to that of not good things, thus cancelling out any positive or negative changes. 

I hope this has helped shed some light on what’s going on and curb some FUD I’ve seen circulating in the sub."

16,“Crypto is just another Dot-Com bubble waiting to burst”…,142,rp4fmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rp4fmx/crypto_is_just_another_dotcom_bubble_waiting_to/,242,1640548391.0,"Crypto being just another Dot-com bubble that is waiting to burst is a popular refrain that we hear across reddit subs, social media and from our uncle Larry at family dinner.  Let's assume for argument's sake that this will turn out to be true, should this give us any reason to question why we are all here as active crypto investors? But first, a little bit about the Dot-com bubble.

In the early to mid 1990’s, the internet was rapidly evolving into a form that would be vaguely recognizable to the modern user today.  The use of websites was shifting from a read-only model where you went to a site to read static content, into a more interactive model that allowed users to exchange ideas and content more freely with each other.  The advent of e-commerce was also another huge paradigm shift that was enabled during this period.  By the mid 1990’s it was becoming increasingly clear that there was a new and untapped revenue stream emerging that could be harnessed via e-commerce.  What was not clear however, was how to appropriately value these new opportunities.

Fueled by an mass influx of venture capital, superbowl ads and wishful thinking, the late 1990’s saw massive internet company IPOs created out of virtually nothing with little to no viable products to provide customers.  Some of the most spectacular failures that people commonly associate with this phase are pets.com, webvan.com, and a whole host of other companies that appended .com to their names which you probably have never heard of.  By the year 2000 the market had crashed, resulting in a loss of 5 trillion in market cap by 2002.  Certainly this is a cautionary tale for all of us crypto investors?  Don’t over value speculative assets and companies, and don’t buy into an oversaturated market in the modern day equivalent of late 1999.

However, along with all the jokes about people who invested in drkoop.com, there is another lasting legacy that the dot-com bubble has left us with: The creation of the infrastructure that powers the modern-day internet and everything that runs on it.  Let’s talk for a minute about some other companies that rose out of the dot com bubble.  Amazon.com, founded in 1994 and IPO’d in 1997. Amazon not only takes in $600B+ a year, but also powers a huge chunk on the internet with its AWS service.  Ebay, founded in 1995 and IPO’d in 1998, made peer to peer sales/auctions commonplace.  Google, founded in 1998 and IPO’d in 2004, is the de facto search engine of the internet today.

Back to our question about how we should be thinking about the dot-com bubble in relation to today’s crypto market.  One lesson that the dot com bubble teaches us is that early investments in emerging technologies are crucial to forming a foundation that will provide decades of growth in the future.  Every major company during this time was forced to start forming an “online” strategy and I think it’s very easy to underestimate the impact this had on the growth of the internet in the long run.  Without all the investments made in internet infrastructure during this time, we would not be as far as we are today.  The most exciting part about today’s crypto landscape is that we are watching the foundations of crypto infrastructure being built in front of our very eyes.  Some semblance of what is being built today will be with us for a very long time.  

Secondly, there will be winners and losers in any emerging technology.  While there will be monumental failures ala pets.com, there will also be opportunities to get in on the ground floor of the next amazon or google.  And yes, people that invested in these companies before the bubble burst and held are very very happy with their investments today. This is where your ability to assess a technology and determine for yourself if you believe it has future potential is vitally important.  It’s common to say “do your own research” as a disclaimer for any crypto advice, but you should be asking yourself if each of your investments has potential beyond today’s valuation or the possibility of a random pump tomorrow or next week.  Can you picture your investment powering some segment of the crypto space for years and decades to come? If the answer is yes, you may have found something that not only has the ability to weather a bubble but can emerge as an even better investment on the other side as other solutions fall by the wayside.  So if you’re saying that crypto is the next dot-com bubble, meaning the foundation of a revolutionary tech movement that will have some volatility but will enable exponential growth over the following decades…I say bring it on!"

Eyes are on Reddit now, in fact eyes might even be on your vault. So if you want to keep those precious moons you earned while shamelessly shitposting, you need to setup 2FA yesterday.  

You can setup 2FA easily through settings, you can use Authy or Google, both work fine.  

I’m sure many of you don’t protect your Reddit accounts with the best password, and I’m equally sure many of you signed up with an old email that you barely even use anymore, how strong is that password?  

Don’t become a sob story post. Protect your Moons.  



TL:DR  
*Setup 2FA or Moons begone*"
18,"How reddit going public, will affect (existing and future) community tokens",182,rhmjuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rhmjuw/how_reddit_going_public_will_affect_existing_and/,272,1639644055.0,"**This morning (16-12 CET) Reddit confidentially submitted a draft registration to go public.**  
What got my attention is that on this sub, it seemed like it caused a lot bullish thoughts on community tokens like the one we've got. It made me wonder: ""What is this assumption based off? Are there any arguments or examples that point towards this conclusion?"" So I deeply thought about it, so you don't have to: *(TL;DR at the bottom)*

**Community Tokens:**  
Before we get into anything, let’s take a look at what a community token is. 

Community tokens, at the heart of it, are created as a means to gain access to a community. They’re a type of cryptocurrency specifically designed to open the door to a particular digital group. You can think of them like membership cards, but based on the blockchain. 

What the token can do, and what sort of access it offers, fully depends on the project behind it. Each social token represents a community and each community has a different value offer.

So for example Bricks on the Fortnite subreddit or ours.

**Reddit going public:**  
With Reddit going public, a few things are going to happen:

* It's going to get a lot more focused on making profits (Think ads and sponsorships etc)
* It will have more funds to promote and grow its user base

This will result in a lot more active members of subreddits. Now Reddit has already pointed out that it will embrace other subreddits who want to make their own community token so more subreddits will get their own community token and at the same time grow their community with new people joining in as a result of the promoting done with the funds of the IPO. 

With this the first contribution to the community tokens will be made: The Supply and demand basic model. By growing the number of users and only having a set number of tokens will increase the demand. This will result in a growth of the price of these tokens. 

Further more, if more people start earning these community tokens, people who don't use reddit but are into crypto will start looking into these coins as well.   
Look at yourself for example; Most of you don't actually make use of the DOT or ADA blockchain yourself, but because you believe in the project you invest in it anyway. This will be the same with the community coins. 

Now here is the part where I start speculating so don't quote me on this, but:  
If there are going to be substantially more users that are going to engage with community coins, and non reddit users wanting to profit from these projects, it won't stay unnoticed: Big exchanges will pick up on these trends and start looking how they can profit from this, with the answer being: Listing these coins on your exchange. Now if this happens, and I am saying IF, this will be very bullish for the reddit community tokens. It will enable everyone on earth with acces to the exchange to trade our community coins, and it will cause an astronomic rise demand with supply staying the same. This obviously is the most bullish case.

**TL;DR / conclusion:**  
**In the end it all comes down to supply and demand; going public will substantially increase the user base of reddit (because of all the promotion and branding that is gonna be done with the raised money by the IPO). This in turn will increase demand without raising supply, causing a rise in the value of the community tokens. This high demand and low supply will be picked up by big exchanges as an opportunity to profit from it. They will try to list these coins on their exchange. If the succeed to do so, this will be the most bullish case for the community coins, now being available to be easily traded by everyone.**   


Interested how you guys see this."
19,"Will r/cc moons ""moon"" or will the Reddit roll out of a cryptocurrency token for every sub reddit dilute their value?",30,ro3wjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ro3wjn/will_rcc_moons_moon_or_will_the_reddit_roll_out/,85,1640412656.0,"This is a very interesting subject to me and, I imagine, most of the community.

Reddit recently filed for an IPO and will soon become a publicly traded company.  Amongst some of their future plans is to roll out a type of cryptocurrency for many or maybe even all of their popular subreddits.

Will this help our current moons ""moon"" due to having 1st mover advantage?  Are moons the bitcoin of reddit?  ....and if so, how long will us early adopters hold?  I can imagine lots of selling pressure at $1 if we ever get there.  

Or, alternatively, will every subreddit having their own token steal the thunder of our coin?  Will it dilute enthusiasm?  

Bonus subject, what are the chances reddit does away with moons altogether since now they will be scrutinized as a public company?  


Interesting times ahead.  I know we collectively can only speculate, but i am curious about the communities thoughts 🤔."
