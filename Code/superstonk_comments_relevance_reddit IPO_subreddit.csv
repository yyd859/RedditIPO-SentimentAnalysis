7,hp7enb3,t3_rk1hv9,"I have blockchain dev experience, mainly with ethereum and nfts. A big question is which blockchain to utilize, ethereum layer 1 is far too expensive to utilize for something like this. There are other networks that are cheaper, but there will still be a cost for every post and interaction that changes the state of the contract. Making a private chain is an option that would reduce cost substantially, but would substantially lower decentralization and security. The whole blockchain trilemma.

Understanding the demographic of what users are willing to pay to post, comment, and like content, and also how many hoops they are willing to go through in order to do so is a major deciding factor in all this.

If it's reddit as a whole you're talking about, then there's already a replacement, if forget the name, but it exists already.

There's always running a darkweb forum, and plenty of open source forum like implementations to operate a public discussion forum. Get funding for some servers if you wish to recreate the sub elsewhere, I don't know what it would take based off of not knowing the amount of users (and ddos) attacks you'd have to mitigate...but cloudfare provide services for such things at a cost.

Tbh, I wouldn't join any such forum from a poster I don't know, I hope your heart is in the right place, but I'd much happier bring this to the current mods to implement...and that's where the (a) blockchain comes in...""our bill is x this month, once the wallet reflects that amount stop contributing"".

I get your heart is in the right place, but you're creating problems and issues to those who are in tech...specifically infrastructure like I am...I'm not saying I have the answers, but I can say is I would absolutely not fund your software development of recreating the wheel...best thing about my idea, there's a ton of open information on how to do it, and all it costs is hosting money, not development money...the transfer user statistics can also easily be done with mod controls, hell, a script so some poor sod doesn't have to verify each user account, and even then, doing it manually wouldn't be hard, time consuming for a few people yes, but not hard.

I am still working on it, I have decided to remove 50% of the features and retain basic features. Enough for communities to be built, filled up and conversate. **I can release it anytime, should be able to handle** ***<1 Million users***.

A blockchain social network is same as user-data being replicated over multiple servers spread across regions. It still retains control the single owner(the company). This is basically what my platform is.

Is it a terrible choice? in the long run YES, but in the beginning we have a better user experience and in the future there will be a chance for another startup to out-do the bloated company who decided to stop listening to the userbase OR when they start to mass-censor topics, users and conversations.

I want to be honest up-front about the present, future and If you want to know about the past. I am all ears.  


edit: Obviously it will be expensive burn rate(FOR ME) to run the servers. But if you like the platform, I can set up donations through patreon, or something else. Until I release subscriptions or payments(monetization). There is no plan for Ads at all. I definitely do not want to sell my gme shares.

Before writing something from scratch, look at a load of open source projects that do parts of what you need, like: https://github.com/teddit-net/teddit. But there are loads more to research.

  


Second, you'd be surprised by the amount of non-core code that is need to maintain a successful business. In most business 20% of the code is customer facing, the rest is admin screens, analytics, monitoring, log analysis, notifications, security alerts, and more boring stuff. Ideally get a business analyst that has experience of social web sites and the different projects that are needed.

  


Third, it needs to be self sustainable. Cloud hosting costs money and it mounts uo very quickly. MOASS profits will be huge, but the hosting costs will burn through that money and give you a 6-12 startup runway if the site becomes successful. Thinking about some kind of revenue stream is important, maybe adverts but you don't want to be dependent on FAANG monopolies (including Cloud hosting) what happens if AWS turns off the taps on hosting?

  


The cheapest way to scale is with Kubernetes and data stored on Cloud native database, like Cassandra or DynamoDB. Don't use MongoDB or MySQL, it won't scale after you hit huge user numbers.

  


If I were designing a new Reddit, I'd bring it back to basics. Fuck UI design and make it fast and mainly text. You can add bells and whistles in the mobile apps and a separate team doing frontend UIs.

  


You'll need a fair bit of code time to give tools to Mods. They are the user stories that give Reddit it's uniqueness. UX wise it seems trivial, but there is a LOT of logic in that part of Reddit

Get a team together based on who are contributing

Then do a ICO or some other way of funding it

And build something that generates revenue, not something you hope will get donations etc

1 software dev

1 blockchain dev

1 graphic designer

1 program manager

1 tester

heck, even one is enough if you get a superstar

If we do a proof of stake consensus mechanism, how would we distribute these coins fairly and trust that apes own the vast majority of these coins to trust the consensus mechanism.

I guess my question is...how does one view an NFT if they don't own it?

Not trying to start anything against NFT, I'm genuinely curious since ownership implies that you have control over it.",t3_rsbyv7,1,superstonk
786,hqn851c,t1_hqlhz57,"I'm not really sure all that is necessary.  Hedge funds or the stock market don't own the DD's, and they are copyrighted materials just by virtue of being published.  The authors may not have intended to ever have to think on it beyond it's initial posting, but others can't technically just come and remove it from places they have no influence over.  Yes, technically, they could remove it from reddit, but I feel they know that would be pointless, and just paint reddit in a bad light, so what's the point since it would just draw attention to it, and censorship issues such as these tend to gain a lot of traction on social media.

I have a feeling with how big this all is, it'd just blow up in their faces if they tried.

I could potentially see them trying to take down the sub, but I don't think it'll be IPO one day, a few days later, SuperStonk and other GME related subs are suddenly banned.  It'd take time to get to that point, and likely other signs would exist that they were going to attempt such a move.

I think people are worrying too much about all this IPO stuff.  Some are certainly already presenting the worst case scenario as if it's a done deal.

But to me, if wall street wants to buy out reddit, it's for the same reason they buy out other media franchises.  To control what they want to push for their own gains.  GME itself is pretty much already going to screw them.  Disrupting the community isn't going to save them.",t3_rsbyv7,2,superstonk
787,hqn9faw,t1_hqm3tbo,"Yeah.  Reddit had investors, and at some point those investors are going to want to cash in.  Reddit is hot right now, so it's a good time to cash in.

Market players may try to capture a significant portion of those shares, but my guess it's not to squash GME talk, but to have a ready supply of ignorant investors to peddle their P&D's too, and control their narratives as they see fit.  Same reason they buy up any other media outlet.

Worth remembering that the entirety of market players aren't all against GME.  Some are greedy in general and see the potential that reddit holds for them regardless of the current risk.  GME's squeeze will come, then go, and even if it stays high, those that stick around are going to have their sites on the future.",t3_rsbyv7,1,superstonk

I personally have a few of the bigger ones downloaded for easier reading stored somewhere on my computer.

790,hqlfsp9,t1_hqlfj6h,"That's fine. The entire DD library is held off of reddit. It's completely separate. Yes,, DD was posted on reddit.

798,hqn6xeh,t1_hqlgrfh,"OK.

Gonna stop this FUD right now.  Amazon isn't going to go and take a bribe from wall street and delete any and all copies of any DD that may exist on any clients account.  Amazon doing so would cost them a hell of a lot more than they'd gain from anything that wall street would be willing to put up.  This would kill the idea that the cloud is a safe place for a company to keep their content, and would basically be handing the reigns to other players, such as MS, or open source cloud projects, or completely shatter any trust that companies have for cloud in the first place.

Data security is a big thing for these providers, and if this data gets taken down, it'll have to be targeted at individual clients through other means, and wouldn't require participation by Amazon or other players.

Beyond that, there is a lot of data redundancy on the internet.  Even the things google censors, many of which have been reported, are still able to be found on google servers.  Hell, old reddit posts can still be perused through offsite cache sites which are in no way part of reddit, and not purged just because a comment is deleted.

Overall, people are worrying way too much about this reddit IPO.  Reddit is valued high right now, partly due to what's happened with GME this year.  Reddit had investors early on, and those investors are going to want a return on their investment.  Reddit was going to IPO at some point, and there is no reason to believe that this IPO is some subversive way for reddit to somehow quell the rebellion.

People need to relax and think more broadly about this, and stop assuming any and everything is related to GME.

If you're really worried about the DD, download it all, rename it, put it into an encrypted zip file, and put it on a bunch of free servers all over the internet.  Pass it around to friends to hold on their computers, or put it on some USB drives.  If it gets taken down, there are likely thousands among the millions that have a backup of it somewhere.",t3_rsbyv7,1,superstonk

876,hos1zp1,t3_rhqfkd,"Not completely on topic, but an idea in the event that Reddit *does* drop: Get the DD onto the ETH blockchain. Mint all the DD articles as NFTs, code the contracts to enable access via a fungible token (if that's a thing?), send each NFT to an inaccessible wallet so it can't be bought or sold by anybody, and spread the FTs far and wide across the internet. Free access to research articles that can literally never be taken down as long as Ethereum exists, and remain accessible to everyone as long as at least one access token continues to exist - and every access topken can be duplicated to allow access to new readers.

I am *not* an authority on crypto by any means, and I don't know whether or not this is actually possible/viable. But if it is, I think it would be a good way to effectively immortalise the DD in the event that Reddit drops, and/or the whole ""cyber pandemic"" event MSM has been telegraphing for the last few years hits before or during MOASS and wipes them off the internet. I know apes have been backing up the DD off the net as well, which is excellent in its own right.

If Reddit were to come together as individuals and all individually buy shares at the IPO and DRS them, all of this goes away once the apes here own Reddit outright.

Retail owns Gamestop.  The media says this is not so, but they are lying.  Retail has more power than they know.  Even after a year of empowerment and now watching hedgies fall almost daily, still doesn't even get it.  They have the power to move markets and change the world already.

But they're waiting for some miserable end instead?  Asking ""where do we go?""  Why not just stay, buy all the shares and DRS them, problem solved in the most F U way you can.  Take the FUD and turn it into your advantage, buy shares cheaper and DRS them en masse, all this goes away.  No need for an alternative when you literally own the company and all it's shares and never relinquish them to corporate vested interest.

But nobody even mentions this solution or talks about it so in my mind, it's doomed to go another way.  People just beaten down so hard they automatically give up not realizing they had all the power, they were just led to believe otherwise.

Apes here should know better, after this whole year.  The answer is evident.  Buy it, DRS it, own it.  Make the megacorp sweat and beat them at their own game!

it's not clear to me how to orchestrate the p-2-p hosting and infosec element.

Not really sure how to answer your question. I assume this list is to organize and apes can swarm some yet to be determined idea. Not sure any of that is sorted out yet.

I do think as a community it‚Äôs been damn impressive seeing the changes, overcoming issues, kicking out shills, etc. If I had to put my money on a group tat is going to show the digital world w to build something the right way in the right intention and mindset, I‚Äôd see it happening in here.

Anyways, who knows where it goes but being able to build a community of like-minded apes who want to make stuff is a pretty cool initial step.
