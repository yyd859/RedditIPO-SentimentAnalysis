114,hp7zfnq,t1_hp7st3r,"DRS is an acronym for direct registration of shares. This means that the shares are being directly registered to your name in GameStop‚Äôs shareholder registry.

This is different from a broker because what you‚Äôre really holding with a broker is a contract that entitles you to the rights of a share but you‚Äôre not actually an owner of the share. You‚Äôre considered a ‚Äúbeneficial owner‚Äù with this arrangement and I‚Äôm no lawyer but it seems to mean they can legally do whatever the fuck they want with assets you thought you owned.

Do your own research. I highly encourage it because I think once you do you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs the only way. We might as well be placing our shares under Ryan cohens bed.",t3_rk1ti6,16,GME
115,hp7uzyr,t1_hp7st3r,"It's a way to own shares of a company in your own name rather than relying on your broker to hold your shares for you under a ""street name""",t3_rk1ti6,6,GME

120,hp7p57c,t1_hp7oevc,"Yeah I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre fucked if Reddit goes down, replied with this to someone else earlier but hope this clarifies what I was going for: 

I don't think not having Reddit would take us down but it's definitely our biggest weapon. No doubt we would find some alternative platform, but it would probably have a fraction of the users, interaction, and reach.

There might be enough people continuing to DRS/buy through Computershare to get there anyway, but it would definitely take longer and I don't want to give them more time to figure out creative new ways to fuck us.",t3_rk1ti6,2,GME
121,hp85azq,t1_hp83009,"Sure. I‚Äôm not familiar with Reddit‚Äôs org chart or how decision making works there necessarily, but I do know that people bringing in the money typically make the rules.

The situation I‚Äôm picturing is that Reddit goes public, then some shf (or group of SHFs) buy 15-20% of the company and start telling Reddit‚Äôs board that ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù subs like gme and superstonk are a bad look for advertisers and regulators and that they should treat us like qanon.

It would also help the overall market and he could be ""persuaded"" to relieve some stress. It may not be enough if the shorting is really bad, like say 250% SI but RC can both get rich and then come back in when the stock price normalizes. I know folks might day he could be tagged for ""manipulation"" but I don't see that happening. Isn't his two year lock up period expiring eary next year?
