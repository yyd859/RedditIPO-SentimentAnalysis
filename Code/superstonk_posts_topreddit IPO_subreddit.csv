0,Once reddit IPO's I want to reimplement it. But I can't do it alone.,10435,rk1hv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rk1hv9/once_reddit_ipos_i_want_to_reimplement_it_but_i/,1511,1639935287.0,"As a software architect, I know how to do this technically.  We will create a blockchain-based ""reddit clone"" as open source together. This will be the biggest Ape migration ever (your karma will be kept).

One man can't do it alone though.  I am not interested in the ownership of the clone either. It would be best if there was no owner at all. All I want free and censorship free communication, truth and nothing but the truth.

We will need:

* Software developers
* blockchain experts
* project managers
* graphic designers
* translators
* lawyers
* managers/CEO
* etc...

**The work will be voluntary, no salary will be paid**. I thought after the MAOSS this will not be necessary for you.

So if you want to be part of it, if you think you can help, post here. If Reddit is so insane and decides to IPO, we will get started.

I thought only a couple would response. Now look at this. How can the HFs even dream of a chance to win?

This spirit is insane. Thank you guys for the support.

**EDIT#2: Blockchain-Based?? WTF?**

There seems to be confusion as to what was meant by Blockchain-Based.

Here are a few keywords:

* Decentralization (main feature)
* developers and hackers are not able to get the (private) user data. It is at least extremely difficult.
* It is impossible for a hacker to manipulate contributions afterwards
* It is impossible for a person (hacker) to exclude or disenfranchise a user. community has that under its control. (remember why we already have two sub migrations behind us?)
* Example: Loopring donation instead of award."

""Commissions"") that define key terms used and exemptions provided for in Title VII ofthe

enter into interest-rate, currency and credit default swaps to manage their currency reserves and 
domestic mortgage and related securities portfolios. Agencies potentially affected include 
central banks, treasury ministries, export agencies and housing finance authorities. The volume

entities, many of which are active participants in the swaps markets for legitimate governmental 
purposes. To require non-U.S. agencies to register with the Commissions as swap dealers and 
major swap participants would produce an incongruous result and would represent both an 
unwarranted extraterritorial application of U.S. law and an unacceptable intrusion on the 
sovereignty of foreign nations.

TA;DR

The law firm he worked at represent literally every shit bank there is and some funds, they were involved in sketchy parts of Dodd-Frank allowing foreign entities to not report, they assist banks and funds in predatory lending/ vulture investing,  they were involved in Enron, Lehman Brothers, represent the Rockefellers, Citadel owned 10% of ETrade and forced a sell and they showed up to represent Goldman Sachs,  bankrupted a mining company in California that does rare minerals MCPIQ with Oaktree, killed a cable competitor with HSBC in 2004 and have some super questionable practices.


He goes to the SEC and starts cock blocking regulation *on shit they influenced when it was made.* [As seen recently.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/secs-partisan-divide-on-display-as-republican-commissioners-object-to-gensler-plan-to-overturn-trump-era-rules-11623701634) 

> “Perhaps the absence of these rules is attributable to the regrettable decision to spend our scarce resources to undo a number of rules the Commission just adopted.”

> Indeed, the agenda contains several proposals to revise rules adopted less than a year ago, including rules reigning in companies that provide advice on how institutional shareholders should vote on shareholder proposals, a rule mandated by the Dodd-Frank legislation that resource-extraction firms disclose payments made to foreign governments in countries where they operate and a rule that limited payments to whistleblowers that alert the SEC of wrongdoing at private companies.

MSM, these brokers, literally doing everything in their power to push FUD onto GameStop and crush any momentum.  It is no accident this headline stayed on top all day.

*7 Potential IPOs in 2022:  Discord, OpenSea...*

https://preview.redd.it/3abtdv3cel881.jpg?width=1136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afeb49953eb908419f82630c2992d6c645da1da5

To be honest, at first I couldn't even figure out why that headline was on the GME ticker to begin with.   Must be some typical fluff in the article where they mention GME to make sure they attach this misleading headline to the ticker.  Then it hit me, ""Oh, they are responding through headlines to the superstonk reddit posts that created the current NFT Marketplace hype.  WTF?""

&#x200B;

Let's make this clear, they do not want GameStop NFT marketplace to be successful.  This breaks the mold about what they thought GameStop was, what and why they were shorting, and even what they thought it was going to be going forward.  This nft marketplace isn't just GameStop moving into e-commerce, which they can compare to other companies attempting the same and easily fud as GameStop makes this transition.  This marketplace is a **game**changer. *Enough of a gamechanger that MSM is prematurely trying to push another nft marketplace into IPO territory.*  Yesterday I made a post stating that GameStop NFT marketplace would be the only public company that had a NFT marketplace, which could lead to other major companies interested in creating NFTs being open to working with them.  The brand is on the public market, trustworthy, and accountable.  This made the front page.   Sure enough, the following day MSM releases a  fallacious headline mentioning OpenSea being a possible IPO for 2022.  Because, well, anything is *possible* right?  I guess it's not a lie if its possible.

They read our reddit and literally the next day counter any buzz points we make with **misleading** headlines.  This was no coincidence.

So what do I do?  I look into it.

The headline is deceptive, as opensea has publicly stated they are not planning an IPO.   On December 9, 2021, after a huge backlash within the OpenSea community, Chief financial officer Brian Roberts, is quoted as saying:

“Let me set the record straight: there is a big gap between thinking about what an IPO might eventually look like & actively planning one. **We are not planning an IPO,** and if we ever did, we would look to involve the community.”

Of course MSM ignores that, as that doesn't help stop GME's momentum.  Benzinga creates the headline, throws GME in the article with some fluff point to make sure it stickies to your ticker, and the brokers sit it right on top your favorite stonks news feed all day (and night).

Anyway.  I no longer believe anything with the GME ticker is a coincidence, glitch, or accident.  They see the momentum with the NFT marketplace, GameStop being a known brand, a publicly traded company, and hopefully first in the race to bring a NFT marketplace to the table for mainstream projects and releases (games, exclusive game items, collectables in nft form, sports collectables \*no longer need to pay to have a sports card verified authentic - nft does this for you\*, movie collectables, shoe collectables \*no longer need to keep our receipts due to counterfeiting\*).  If you believe in this group of guys running the company then you know they have bigger ideas than just transitioning to e-commerce.  The marketplace shows us that.  MSM can't let this happen and these fucking guys will stop at nothing.  They have name recognition, 1.4b on the back burner, no debt, and a markerplace in the works that could be a gamechanger (see the great reply below to see what this marketplace could mean for GameStop).  The bottom line is, this headline actually reinforces what we already knew, the new marketplace is a company changer, or a whole new company within a company.  Bullish.

And to reiterate, THIS IS WHY GME KEEP THEIR PLANS QUIET.  They know the media is against them and will purposely do the above to ANYTHING they announce."

Whatever stories they propagate, data they share, fud they print, bots and shills they deploy, or subreddits they destroy are as worthless as the USD is about to become. There is literally nothing they can say or do that will change my mind. Nothing they say or do will keep me from diamond handing GME in CS and buying more whenever I can.

**Quick Note from a Crayon Eatin' Dick Puncher**

Hello Apes - u/happy_dick_punch here. You might know me from my previous hits around glitches, shitposting memes, dropping some music covers, kicking around the banter or just eating some crayons round here.

Long story short, I’ve also got a background in digital. Been having some good discussions this past week related to the Reddit IPO stuff, backups, preserving, archiving and then considering the future. I own [gmeforever.com](http://gmeforever.com/) and offered that as a space if we want to think about utilizing it as a future house for whatever.

Ok, This post is about archiving all the folks who are talking and volunteering and want to consider collaborating. Putting this list together so you apes can have a place of reference to find, connect, engage, volunteer and hopefully keep things rolling. Lots of talented little silverback brains in here.

Been seeing and involved in a few discussions over the past week around building backups of our beloved home here on r/SuperStonk and preserving the archives while also considering how we might move forward in the future.

There have been great discussions and talking with people and seeing all the amazing talent.

I scraped a bunch of posts, comments and people who raised their hands to put together a list for organizing and archiving everyone who wants to be involved in various little projects, etc around digital, data, development, design, etc.

Below are some posts I have scraped with usernames.

11,"We are apes and we don't take shit we fling shit. Reddit wants to go IPO (make no mistake superstonk and whatever subreddit we migrate to will get shut down) that's cool, we don't need Reddit!",480,rhp8xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rhp8xs/we_are_apes_and_we_dont_take_shit_we_fling_shit/,95,1639655794.0,"If Reddit is going to pull this bullshit and eventually end up shutting us down then why don't we create our own platform to communicate?? One ran, controlled and funded by apes?? Or maybe we can contact GameStop or just see if they have a way we can all communicate? Don't get this shit twisted they are being bought out and eventually going to shut us and our communication/community down. We've taken matters into our own hands every step of the way and now our opponents is trying to outsmart us.. we have to be proactive with this shit if we want to stay on top and keep our community going. As always BUY, HOLD, DRS!!!🦧🚀

All I'm suggesting is depending on how all this goes we should be proactive with this. Would really suck to wake up one day and superstonk is gone"
12,"Let's Talk~ If anything, Reddit's actions last night with removing the Gradante post from main page and ""temporarily"" removing upvotes, shows us they will not make it easy to share information. Especially after they possibly IPO in the coming months.",311,rxee96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rxee96/lets_talk_if_anything_reddits_actions_last_night/,29,1641475043.0,"As the title says, once Reddit IPO's, the censorship will most likely only get worse. We need to be preparing ourselves for when this time comes. We've seen this week alone the upvote/downvote buttons be hidden on some accounts and now we see that if there is some ""potentially"" damaging information for the powers that be, Reddit will just magically ""have an outage"" to alter the performance of the post. 

Many of us primarily only get our information from upvoted posts on ""hot"" or ""DD flair"" on this sub or others like it. If the SHF, or others that are against us, can disrupt our flow of valuable information, that would be a powerful tool to use against us. Who knows, this may never come to fruition, but we need to come up with a way to pass on vital information just in case. I'm not entirely sure a way for us to avoid this. I know we have Gangum Style, but that doesn't seem like the best alternative method.

Y'all feel free to discuss below and maybe we can come up with something together. Then hopefully, if enough people agree, we can pin the instructions at the top of the sub (like the computershare instructions) so that it will be easily found by new apes down the road after MOASS starts and the FOMO crowd starts pouring in."
13,"Reddit getting an IPO, with $400M investment from Fidelity. Is this important?",309,rhkm7l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/rhkm7l,103,1639636145.0,
14,"I’m calling it now, Reddit & Lego will be one of the first companies to IPO on the rumoured GameStop DEX",303,rezp85,https://i.imgur.com/waViQHp.jpg,22,1639347172.0,
15,DRS IS THE WAY. This is why....,254,s05yb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/s05yb0/drs_is_the_way_this_is_why/,19,1641774126.0,"So firstly, owning the stock in your actual name, like the good ol' days, who wouldn't want that?

More importantly, Gamestop have started releasing updates. Every quarter we get to know how many of the total shares outstanding have been direct registered - by REAL named shareholders.

Price discovery, absolutely, categorically, has to be accurate once those shares are locked up. There's no hiding it.

Can they sell options once the float is locked - I don't know, seems like we would be entering unknown territory; a territory where technically 'market maker privileges' become null and void - there are no additional shares available.

That's the real crux of this. At that point, Gamestop shares are NO LONGER AVAILABLE. What happens then? What about all the thousands (probably millions) of people that haven't DRS'ed? What are they holding?

Just start the process. If you haven't already, start DRS'ing. The idea that you'll miss the MOASS is wrong. You can't miss the MOASS if the shares are locked up. It's impossible, where are they going to close short positions from?

Some perks for having them in your actual name:

* You're a real shareholder in a company you love.
* You will have the opportunity to receive whatever dividend they offer.
* (My personal favourite theory for the 741\*) Computershare isn't going to go bankrupt - they're a transfer agent, not a broker - your shares are safe.
* I think everyone is forgetting the fact that when the infinity pool is actually established, that's what will keep the price at astronomical levels. There's no coming down from that. Shares are locked by the transfer agent. People will sell when they feel the price is representative of their investment value. Even if you considered for a second that there would be no MOASS, the fair value of Gamestop will be in the thousands, and no one will sell before then. (And if a few people did - there will be thousands of people waiting to take their place.)
* This is a weird scenario - it will never happen again. Giveashare website has GME listed as number 1 gift purchase. Above Disney. Apes internationally, have been doing their thing and buying certificates just to open CS accounts to direct register. If anything (because of the time lags in postal) - we will start to see more CS momentum building.

\*741 is the start of the broker bankruptcy code. That seems way too coincidental to not be relevant for all the shitty brokers out there. RC has our back. [https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/](https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/)

As my final point - and it's controversial - I'm still wary of options. There is such a thing as dynamic investors (people who move the markets) and passive investors, basically retail). The last year has turned me into Brad Pitt from The Big Short (mentally of course...unfortunately not physically) . I don't trust any of it. That's why registering my shares through the transfer agent that is assigned directly by Gamestop, is the ONLY way I know I have actual shares in the company I love. And I do love it. It's going to the top apes, and we need to actually OWN it. Nothing is ever easy - make the move, direct register your shares now, and get included in the next report.

Peace, love, apes together strong - 🚀🔜🌕

EDIT: It's amazing what they're capable of. They're experts in algorithms and a reddit algorithm will be pretty basic. You'ed be able to keep this post gaining upvotes while still downvoting systematically, and ultimately it will just die out in 'new'. On the other hand, any posts which are intended to deflect from DRS'ing, or are ultra pro for options - you can award and scale the upvotes in order to push it straight through to hot. Anyone who doesn't think we're being played, right here on our home turf (even before a Reddit IPO) is sorely mistaken. "
16,"🙈 Reddit Leadership - with their IPO conveniently happening now, and perhaps at the behest of Fidelity and company - are aggressively inserting themselves as the primary benefactor, profiteer, and racketeer in this historic MOASS 'Tug of War' between societal classes 🙈",259,rjq19k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rjq19k/reddit_leadership_with_their_ipo_conveniently/,37,1639892547.0,"Consider the timing as the evidence that supports this theory.  ""We're in the endgame now.""  As I have stated before, the clock is ticking, and the clock is not in our favor.  As many of us like to use the word 'zen' as if it justifies inaction, I beg to differ.

Many a great youtuber have been in agreeance on one thing: that shills and infiltrators, inside our open/free forums, are making every attempt to prevent MOASS while engaging in psychological warfare and issuing propaganda.  These shills and infiltrators are actually funded by the same entities who got caught red-handed in their illegal practice of destroying hundreds of American companies by shorting them to death, and while funding the media to force a false sentiment upon the masses.  We know these hedge funds are backed by their brokers, and who brazenly circumnavigate securities laws and financial regulations.  J.P. Morgan and Chase Co just admitted to guilt in their violation of securities laws.  Note: this news was released on a friday (the day where PR teams release news when they want to hide something or minimize their reputational harm).  Also read about Goldman Sachs fraud during the Great Recession, the $600B bailout, and how often the SEC (effectively dirty cops) accept hundred-million dollar deals in lieu of real justice.  Let us be crystal clear: you rarely, if ever, see any of these crooks behind bars where they belong.  They write a check instead.

But this writeup is not meant to become a sob story; I am no gadfly.  I want to discuss Reddit's IPO.

We know that Reddit, and its merit-based and open forum for discourse, was the root cause for January 2021.  Reddit allowed for Keith Gill, who is by fact a bold violator of FINRA regulations himself, to advocate for his stock.  GameStop was his all-in bet, and he advocated for over a year for his position (there were moments when that bet was not going well for him).  Yet, Warren Buffett does the same thing.  ""Advocating for your position"" is one of the long-standing rules of successful investing.  (why do you think Warren in his prime bought out so many news companies?)  Although YouTube and other forums were also used, Reddit allowed for a truthful discourse.  Free humans engaging in discussion, sharing of open information.  Yet, in terms of sentiment (which is the source of financial decision making) Reddit is the 'sentiment casino' itself.  Hedge Funds quickly want to become the Dealers in that casino.  As we know, the casino also wins.  After all, they design the games and their odds of winning.

Yet, on the same day that J.P. Morgan was caught ($200M fine), they issue a 'distraction' all over CNBC?  The distraction to their financial crimes was about short selling.  Why?  Well, because the Department of Justice and SEC are busy right now, as they have stated that there is an active CRIMINAL investigation into short-selling practices, specifically.  Essentially, J.P. Morgan being a broker for Melvin Capital (legal Target) quickly went from Group of Interest to Subject.  They paid a lot of money to avoid prosecution on Friday.  Notice, however, that J.P. Morgan jumped on the news to issue propaganda about their take: that a short squeeze is inevitable now, through Christmas, and into year-end.  Because Federal prosecutors were criminally interviewing J.P. Morgan all week, they likely 'jumped ship' onto the good side and, on the same day of the $200M penalty, spoke in favor (all of a sudden) of a short squeeze.  This is why I believe that there will be no fake squeeze, and instead the one squeeze will simply be MOASS.

Reddit Leadership, on the other hand, has been the sole entity in this saga (and very innocent, mind you) who was not attempting to profit.  Apes (mostly low class, some middle class, and few upper class) want MOASS.  That's profit (advocating for their position). Brokers and Hedge Funds (all upper class and connected with the ruling elite) don't want MOASS (shills advocating for their position).  But, as we spoke about before, the medium for advocating for your position is the real money-maker.  In Warren Buffett's day, it was the newspaper companies.  Today, it's the internet.  For investing, though, Reddit just became the ultimate newspaper company for top investors to try to advocate from. Hedge funds and brokers, therefore, know that this is their only and last chance to infiltrate the source - Reddit - in order for them to try to prevent MOASS.  For these reasons, combined with the fact that FUDelity's $400M was one of the largest and earliest funding in their pre-IPO rounds, I believe Reddit Leadership was solicited.  I believe that Reddit Leadership probably did not want to go public, but that their company became what will forever be known as the battleground for the largest sentiment war for the largest potential transfer of wealth to other societal classes in human history.

And they may have just sold us out for their own gain.  And what is the other problem with this?  Any funds that us Apes use in the quest to buy 51% of Reddit right now are funds not going into GameStop.

With all of this stated, I like the idea of the real MOASS occurring right now, while the prosecution of the Federal Government onto the criminal hedge funds and criminal brokers is clearly so actively hot.  

TLDR;  Reddit Leadership wants to profit from the Apes vs Hedge Fund 'Tug of War.'  Maybe they just wisened up to this spontaneously, or maybe they were given an offer they couldn't refuse?  Reddit is effectively the 'sentiment casino', so who will become the Dealers?  But, the Reddit IPO just became a new financial battleground in the hedge funds' latest, we're-in-the-endgame-now-level distraction to GME.  Thus, only after MOASS occurs, and Ken Griffin is in jail, we can then (and only then) consider diversifying slightly from our GME positions and into the modern day newspaper companies like Reddit, where we can forever-ensure fairness and equal opportunity in the sharing of free, public information."

I'm thinking once it IPOs, the objectivity that reddit once boasted will be lost forever, and of course Reddit will be at the beck and call of the major shareholders, which will most definitely be wallstreet FIs.

Then they'll hire some black market hacker to hack and delete the few DD repositories that's not on reddit, like that DD library someone made. 

And with this erasure of all the DD that exposes their shit, and by removing one of the only platforms we have to communicate these atrocities, they would hope that the excellent DDs that expose them will never resurface again. 

This is why I think apes who are computer science inclined should protect the DDs with some high tech CS stuff, but I'm not one of these apes."
19,IRA: to DRS or Not to DRS... Just who the F is Ally Investments?,139,rme99l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rme99l/ira_to_drs_or_not_to_drs_just_who_the_f_is_ally/,22,1640205622.0,"THIS IS NOT DD, THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVICE...  (It is what it is.)

I've seen a lot of chatter about [Ally Investments](https://www.ally.com/invest/). Some apes have decided to take the plunge, others still wait perched on the brokerage fence deliberating whether or not they would want to transfer their GME shares that reside in their IRA.

First, I'd like to remind each and everyone of you that it is your choice whether you choose to move your IRA over to Ally or Not.

So why move your IRA? So that your GME shares can be directly registered through ComputerShare.

There are countless apes eager to see the float locked via direct registration. As such you would be wise to remember that although apes are encouraging this action they are none the wiser than you. So do your research first. That's just what I've been doing... I'm sure some of you have as well, so let's hear your thoughts in the comments!!

First lets fire up the browser and duckduckgo some shiiit... What's this, wikipedia? Seems like a good place to start:

At first glance I'm not particularly impressed by their recent history.

&#x200B;

[Whenever you hear subprime think \\""Shit\\""](https://preview.redd.it/l9tvd6wla5781.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bf110e62782cae23b2d1ba7ad02f6e708caf993)

That's right subprime loans... I know what you're thinking, ""but but everyone was doing it back in the day. We all smoked crack, banana peels, and snorted coke off a donkey dick somewhere in South America."" ***Wait you weren't thinking that?*** Well that's because we all weren't doing that... just some people, and not all banks / financial institutions were slanging subprime loans to unsuspecting citizens who were just looking for a home. But ALLY was.... oh I'm sorry it was a subdivision of Ally ""[**Nuvell Financial Services**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuvell_Financial_Services)**""  AND THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.**

Not surprised GMAC Commercial Holdings AKA  **Capmark** filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and ultimately acquired by Berkadia (a [joint venture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture) of [Leucadia National](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferies_Financial_Group) and [Berkshire Hathaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway).)

So lets fast forward to 2014 where they had their IPO and in 2016 acquired **TradeKing** which was rebranded to **Ally Invest.** Nasdaq shows that [Ally's institutional ownership](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ally/institutional-holdings) is 90.52% So who are these institutions?

&#x200B;

[F\*cking sus](https://preview.redd.it/u1i0mef5f5781.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd11b4a970a7fa03ce1e0732580f24c690981224)

I find it interesting that Fidelity and Goldman have considerably reduced their exposure. However, I find it more interesting that both Vanguard and Fidelity have some significant holdings in a company that will DRS our shares (as a custodian) but neither of them will do so themselves directly. (Also worth noting that you should sort by Change % and Change(shares) to see who's come and gone... )

I'd like to know more about TradeKing, other than they were ""fined $5,000 by FINRA after it failed to fully report transactions in its regular audit of trading activity. About 10 percent of transactions were excluded from the audit."" Interesting nonetheless... Maybe one of you apes knows more?

I was able to find out more on [fines issued to Ally Financial and it's subsidiaries.](https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/ally-financial) Not exactly Mr. Clean, but somewhat expected given their past with subprime loans. Yet here are some of the Fines for those who don't want to view the link:

**The Summary:**

&#x200B;

Finally on to their 2016 reentry into the mortgage business (direct-to-consumer offering called Ally Home). In April 2019, **Ally Home partnered with Better.com** to launch a digital mortgage platform.Wait... [BETTER.COM?!?](https://BETTER.COM?!?) Why does this sound familiar?  Hmm yes this [piece of DD from 9 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnnvcq/for_those_dd_gods_on_the_everything_short/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&user_id=699112216640&web_redirect=true)

>It processed $25B worth of mortgage refinancing transactions in 2020 and $14B in Q1 2021

That's a lot of refinancing... but ""quick pre-approval, instant loan estimates, rate locks, lower rates, and fees.""  \*\*\*Who doesn't love Quick Pre-Approval?!?!?\*\*\*If you all recall, [Better..com fired 15% of their staff over zoom the other week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miq85pDnfX8).

&#x200B;

Apes... your mission should you accept is to dig a little deeper, ask more questions, find out more. Disagree with my concerns? Great!!! **Tell us why though**, **back up your opinion with data and share it with the community.** I'm not the only one weary of transferring my GME shares from my IRA to Ally. So lets put our wrinkles together and hopefully more neurons will ignite some meaningful conversation.

TLDR: WTF is Ally and why do they not seem like my ALLY?  As it stands I'd rather take the taxable event and DRS myself with no custodian.

As always, BUY HOLD DRS (rinse repeat)!!!
