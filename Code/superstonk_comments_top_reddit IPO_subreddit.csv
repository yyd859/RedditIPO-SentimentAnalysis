7,hp7enb3,t3_rk1hv9,"I have blockchain dev experience, mainly with ethereum and nfts. A big question is which blockchain to utilize, ethereum layer 1 is far too expensive to utilize for something like this. There are other networks that are cheaper, but there will still be a cost for every post and interaction that changes the state of the contract. Making a private chain is an option that would reduce cost substantially, but would substantially lower decentralization and security. The whole blockchain trilemma.

Understanding the demographic of what users are willing to pay to post, comment, and like content, and also how many hoops they are willing to go through in order to do so is a major deciding factor in all this.

If it's reddit as a whole you're talking about, then there's already a replacement, if forget the name, but it exists already.

There's always running a darkweb forum, and plenty of open source forum like implementations to operate a public discussion forum. Get funding for some servers if you wish to recreate the sub elsewhere, I don't know what it would take based off of not knowing the amount of users (and ddos) attacks you'd have to mitigate...but cloudfare provide services for such things at a cost.

Tbh, I wouldn't join any such forum from a poster I don't know, I hope your heart is in the right place, but I'd much happier bring this to the current mods to implement...and that's where the (a) blockchain comes in...""our bill is x this month, once the wallet reflects that amount stop contributing"".

I get your heart is in the right place, but you're creating problems and issues to those who are in tech...specifically infrastructure like I am...I'm not saying I have the answers, but I can say is I would absolutely not fund your software development of recreating the wheel...best thing about my idea, there's a ton of open information on how to do it, and all it costs is hosting money, not development money...the transfer user statistics can also easily be done with mod controls, hell, a script so some poor sod doesn't have to verify each user account, and even then, doing it manually wouldn't be hard, time consuming for a few people yes, but not hard.

I am still working on it, I have decided to remove 50% of the features and retain basic features. Enough for communities to be built, filled up and conversate. **I can release it anytime, should be able to handle** ***<1 Million users***.

A blockchain social network is same as user-data being replicated over multiple servers spread across regions. It still retains control the single owner(the company). This is basically what my platform is.

Is it a terrible choice? in the long run YES, but in the beginning we have a better user experience and in the future there will be a chance for another startup to out-do the bloated company who decided to stop listening to the userbase OR when they start to mass-censor topics, users and conversations.

I want to be honest up-front about the present, future and If you want to know about the past. I am all ears.  


edit: Obviously it will be expensive burn rate(FOR ME) to run the servers. But if you like the platform, I can set up donations through patreon, or something else. Until I release subscriptions or payments(monetization). There is no plan for Ads at all. I definitely do not want to sell my gme shares.

Before writing something from scratch, look at a load of open source projects that do parts of what you need, like: https://github.com/teddit-net/teddit. But there are loads more to research.

  


Second, you'd be surprised by the amount of non-core code that is need to maintain a successful business. In most business 20% of the code is customer facing, the rest is admin screens, analytics, monitoring, log analysis, notifications, security alerts, and more boring stuff. Ideally get a business analyst that has experience of social web sites and the different projects that are needed.

  


Third, it needs to be self sustainable. Cloud hosting costs money and it mounts uo very quickly. MOASS profits will be huge, but the hosting costs will burn through that money and give you a 6-12 startup runway if the site becomes successful. Thinking about some kind of revenue stream is important, maybe adverts but you don't want to be dependent on FAANG monopolies (including Cloud hosting) what happens if AWS turns off the taps on hosting?

  


The cheapest way to scale is with Kubernetes and data stored on Cloud native database, like Cassandra or DynamoDB. Don't use MongoDB or MySQL, it won't scale after you hit huge user numbers.

  


If I were designing a new Reddit, I'd bring it back to basics. Fuck UI design and make it fast and mainly text. You can add bells and whistles in the mobile apps and a separate team doing frontend UIs.

  


You'll need a fair bit of code time to give tools to Mods. They are the user stories that give Reddit it's uniqueness. UX wise it seems trivial, but there is a LOT of logic in that part of Reddit

Get a team together based on who are contributing

Then do a ICO or some other way of funding it

And build something that generates revenue, not something you hope will get donations etc

1 software dev

1 blockchain dev

1 graphic designer

1 program manager

1 tester

5 peopl3e is enough

heck, even one is enough if you get a superstar

If we do a proof of stake consensus mechanism, how would we distribute these coins fairly and trust that apes own the vast majority of these coins to trust the consensus mechanism.

707,hpd1hmw,t1_hpcjlip,"Doesn't change the fact that eToro is just an online broker and it has never been able to proof it actually holds any GME shares. 

a) They are not a DTCC registered broker

b) They are registered outside the US (Cyprus iirc, because taxes) so they can legally sell you CFDs

c) They freaked out about the shareholder voting back in June and ended up making some dodgy template to allow GME holders to vote, after weeks of a lot pressure to allow shareholders to vote

d) They don't allow DRS and they can't tell us exactly why. They don't allow regular broker-to-broker transfers either.

e) They constantly change and/or disable users ability to sell short (with a CFD which is fair enough), as well as changing the levels of leverage users can use on securities depending on the price action and outlook for that particular security. 

An example: I opened a short position on Evergrande back in July on eToro. Couple days later after doing more DD on Evergrande and China I felt confident enough to add more to my position with 2X leverage. But by then they had already disabled leverage use on Evergrande shorts but not while going long. About a week before the news broke about Evergrande in late August, they disabled shorts on it all together. It can't be because they can't locate shares to short because you only use CFDs when selling short on eToro. They do the same shit all the time with shitcoins that moon or with pump n dump stocks. They do the same with GME, conveniently allowing leverage just as GME is about to dip by $100 over two weeks. 
They do it because they're on the other side of those trades because all those trades are CFDs.

f) They actually posted [this](https://ibb.co/FnnGW0q)

They're very likely using some sort of swap contracts as an insurance for all the GME CFDs/IOUs that they've sold us.",t3_rkuxnd,4,superstonk

737,hpcn3al,t1_hpce2ex,"Susquehanna own a tiny percentage of the company. Stop with this misinformation and FUD.  

After digging more into who owns the private company that is Etoro until they IPO we can safely say that this is at least very misleading or at worst this is dangerous FUD designed to get people to sell their shares knowing there is no transferring on Etoro.  
  
eToro was founded as RetailFX in 2007\[10\] in Tel Aviv, by brothers Yoni Assia and Ronen Assia together with David Ring.\[11\]  
  
Between 2007 and 2013, the company raised $31.5 million in four rounds of funding.\[14\]\[15\] In December 2014, it raised $27 million from Russian and Chinese investors.\[16\] In December 2017, it joined CoinDash as partners to develop Blockchain-based social trading.\[17\] In 2018, it raised a further $100 million in a private funding round.\[18\] Overall, more than $162 million has been invested in the company by investment firms Spark Capital, SBI Holdings, Germany's CommerzVentures, Chinese bank Ping An Insurance,\[19\] SBT Venture Capital, Russian state-owned financial firm Sberbank,\[20\] Korea Investment Partners, technology-focused BRM Group, and China Minsheng Financial Holdings.\[4\]\[21\]\[22\] Other investors and equity shareholders include Eli and Nir Barkat, Alona Barkat, Chemi Peres and Pitango VC fund, Digital Currency Group, Softbank, Betsy Z. Cohen, Eddy Shalev and Genesis Partners, Avner Stepak (Meitav Dash Investment House), Bracket Capital.\[9\]\[19\]  
  
So along with the equity all these investors own and the probably large percentages the 3 founders own we can pretty safely say that Susquehanna would be very unlikely to own equity large enough in Etoro to be able to sway internal Etoro decisions in any meaningful way. Especially in a way that would undoubtedly hugely harm Etoros reputation and in turn destroy value of the other investors equity in Etoro. Especially before an IPO.

In¬†United States of America v. Aaron Swartz,¬†Aaron Swartz, an¬†American¬†computer programmer, writer, political organizer and¬†Internet activist, was prosecuted for multiple violations of the¬†Computer Fraud and Abuse Act¬†of 1986 (CFAA), after downloading academic journal articles through the MIT computer network from a source (JSTOR) for which he had an account as a Harvard research fellow. Facing trial and the possibility of imprisonment, Swartz committed suicide, and the case was consequently dismissed.[1][2][3]

They're trying to poison the well and it has a lot of gamers throwing hate at NFTs rn. We'd do well to arm ourselves with facts as rebuttals to common NFT misinformation to push back with when encountering this FUD in the wild.

&nbsp;
Edit: Here's a run down of the FUD vectors and some facts that counter them...

&nbsp;
>**NFTs are horrible for the environment**

&nbsp;
The most NFT-dense chain (Ethereum 1.0) uses less energy than the US video games industry. ETH 2.0 will use 90%+ less energy than that next year. A decent and growing percent of that energy is from renewables. Plus the Crypto Climate Accord is already working to realize the goal of a 100% renewables based crypto industry.  

&nbsp;
>**NFTs are just a bunch of jpegs of bad art / NFTs are useless**

&nbsp;
[10 Practical NFT Use Cases Beyond Digital Artworks](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/nft-use-cases/)  

&nbsp;
>**NFTs promote art theft**

&nbsp;
IP theft predates NFTs. Also the immutable blockchain ledger and crypto wallets which require ""Know Your Customer"" identification provide the best trail of evidence you're likely to get in regards to theft/piracy of digital goods. The art thief that minted your work as an NFT left a ledger history leading right to their wallet, the thief who stole all your work and is pretending to be you on social is a goddamn ghost. NFT marketplaces will also likely work with you to resolve any IP theft or fraud.  

&nbsp;
>**NFTs in games are soulless money grubbing by developers**

&nbsp;
NFTs in games will allow you to MAKE MONEY playing them though things like item shops, providing in-game services etc. The point of some finance-focused NFT games is to allow you to ""play to earn"". A lot of early Axie Infinity players got rich from the game, how much did you make watching Blizzard nerf your favorite Overwatch hero fifty times in a row?  

&nbsp;
>**NFTs are a scam**

&nbsp;
Scams exist in crypto/defi, undeniably so. Still spotting the hallmarks of scams is the first thing you learn on the road to becoming savvy in this space. The folks who wind up getting scammed in NFT land are like the type of people who fall for email phishing scams. These are low info users who didn't the DD before spending 10 ETH on an NFT of a vampire donkey somebody told them about on Discord. Did they check the blockchain history to see it had no transactions or maybe it was wash traded to pump the price? Of course not. Having a single brain wrinkle can fix this.  

&nbsp;
>**Artists lose money minting NFTs because gas fees are high**

&nbsp;
NFTs can be minted on chains far far cheaper than Ethereum. Also ETH 2 fees will be far cheaper with sharding planned post-merge next year (or use an L2 like Loopring right now to cut gas fees 90+%). Also NFTs can provide royalties to artists when their work is resold creating an income stream from their past , long sold-off works. Right now they only get paid on the first sale. Imagine a prolific artist still getting royalties from NFTs they sold 20 years ago.

Patience my friend.  The market is all about the impatient giving to the patient.  It hasn't even been a year and the company is in a huge transitional phase.   Ryan Cohen has already helped a lot of people quick flip GME.  He was the catalyst.  Maybe now he is more focused on long term investors, not a short squeeze.  I know that sucks to hear, but he will probably hold through the squeeze, then be right back to business.  His concern is his business and making sure if they do PR, they are ready to do PR.  Good PR.   The last thing he needs is to rush and promote a NFT marketplace when it crashes, can't handle the load, has errors on login pages, who knows!!!!!!  Maybe he is working behind the scenes with various companies and can't speak on any of these deals until they are final.  And these deals won't be final until the marketplace is up and running?!

A few other points which need to be considered as to why a $1B valuation of the ""core"" business no longer makes any sense:

\- Current cash on hand > $1.4B

\- 30% growth last Q

\- 350 new hires from Amazon, Chewy, Microsoft and others

\- Increasing customer engagement and satisfaction - Increased inventory and warehouses for deliveries, USA call centers, much improved social media presence...

These few points alone SHOULD alter the growth calculations of any forward model.  I have no idea where GameStop will be a year or five years from now but there is certainly some ground-breaking shit happening.

If they could, what's to stop troll farms for collapsing every unappealing sub within reach?  Or if there's no way to shut one down, then we have to be okay with letting abhorrent behavior go unchecked (e.g., communities designed to attract and groom children, bomb-making tutorials, echo-chambers for violent rhetoric against disadvantaged groups, etc.).

All that to say, I don't think we have a silver bullet for the problem yet, but I'm currently leaning more towards a leadership through a non-profit.

- I guess this also means that Conde Nast Publications / Advanced Publications have lost money or otherwise they have been financially punished or threatened with relation to Reddit.

- So then the censorship that Fidelity does in the fidelityinvestments subreddit, those censorship humans will censor the fuck out of the entire site far more bullyingly and totalitarianly, oppressively,tyranically, stockholm syndromely than already

- Fidelity [showed their true colors](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rd10yg/fidelitys_november_2021_glitches_fuck_up/) and now Fidelity is gonna fuck up Reddit along with combined forces of other financial terrorists

- Who is the CEO? spez

- November, 2016, a redditor posted evidence indicating that Reddit administrators had modified multiple user comments. Following this post Huffman took responsibility for the comment modifications, writing that ‚ÄúOur community team is pretty pissed at me, so I most assuredly won‚Äôt do this again.‚Äù

- spez, remember that Aaron Swartz was either murdered/killed and framed as a suicide, or even if he was not murdered and that Aaron Swartz,as brilliant as he was, that his brain concluded that he must commit suicide as a solution, that if Aaron Swartz's brain was that smart to no longer be alive (again, even if he was murdered and propagandishly framed as a suicide by financial terrorist hired hitmen, or fbi, domestic terrorists, etcetera), that the position any human is in to survive and stand up against the corruption, it requires a lot of willpower.",t3_rhp8xs,1,superstonk

Those with large positions in a company can indeed influence how it's run, but at the same time, it's not a forgone conclusion, and that influence would take time if those who have controlling interest actually don't want to make something bad happen.  

Shorting reddit out of existence would take years, but in the near term, getting to the actual IPO date, hedge funds gaining enough influence to assign board members, that board doing what would need to be done to have something happen to the sub, that action probably taking months to happen since doing it suddenly would raise red flags, makes it seem like anything we have to worry about could be a year or two away....at the earlier.

If MOASS takes that long, I hate to say it, but reddit shutting down the sub probably isn't going to be the subs biggest concern.  The bigger concern would be people leaving because they're annoyed at either it not MOASS'ing, or the constant fear mongering which gets old week after week.

All that said, I can't see wall street trying to short reddit out of existence.  It's too valuable a vehicle for them to push their P&D's on the common man.

Not trying to start anything against NFT, I'm genuinely curious since ownership implies that you have control over it.",t3_rsbyv7,1,superstonk
3118,hqn851c,t1_hqlhz57,"I'm not really sure all that is necessary.  Hedge funds or the stock market don't own the DD's, and they are copyrighted materials just by virtue of being published.  The authors may not have intended to ever have to think on it beyond it's initial posting, but others can't technically just come and remove it from places they have no influence over.  Yes, technically, they could remove it from reddit, but I feel they know that would be pointless, and just paint reddit in a bad light, so what's the point since it would just draw attention to it, and censorship issues such as these tend to gain a lot of traction on social media.

I have a feeling with how big this all is, it'd just blow up in their faces if they tried.

I could potentially see them trying to take down the sub, but I don't think it'll be IPO one day, a few days later, SuperStonk and other GME related subs are suddenly banned.  It'd take time to get to that point, and likely other signs would exist that they were going to attempt such a move.

I think people are worrying too much about all this IPO stuff.  Some are certainly already presenting the worst case scenario as if it's a done deal.

But to me, if wall street wants to buy out reddit, it's for the same reason they buy out other media franchises.  To control what they want to push for their own gains.  GME itself is pretty much already going to screw them.  Disrupting the community isn't going to save them.",t3_rsbyv7,2,superstonk
3119,hqn9faw,t1_hqm3tbo,"Yeah.  Reddit had investors, and at some point those investors are going to want to cash in.  Reddit is hot right now, so it's a good time to cash in.

Market players may try to capture a significant portion of those shares, but my guess it's not to squash GME talk, but to have a ready supply of ignorant investors to peddle their P&D's too, and control their narratives as they see fit.  Same reason they buy up any other media outlet.

Worth remembering that the entirety of market players aren't all against GME.  Some are greedy in general and see the potential that reddit holds for them regardless of the current risk.  GME's squeeze will come, then go, and even if it stays high, those that stick around are going to have their sites on the future.",t3_rsbyv7,1,superstonk

3130,hqn6xeh,t1_hqlgrfh,"OK.

Gonna stop this FUD right now.  Amazon isn't going to go and take a bribe from wall street and delete any and all copies of any DD that may exist on any clients account.  Amazon doing so would cost them a hell of a lot more than they'd gain from anything that wall street would be willing to put up.  This would kill the idea that the cloud is a safe place for a company to keep their content, and would basically be handing the reigns to other players, such as MS, or open source cloud projects, or completely shatter any trust that companies have for cloud in the first place.

Data security is a big thing for these providers, and if this data gets taken down, it'll have to be targeted at individual clients through other means, and wouldn't require participation by Amazon or other players.

Beyond that, there is a lot of data redundancy on the internet.  Even the things google censors, many of which have been reported, are still able to be found on google servers.  Hell, old reddit posts can still be perused through offsite cache sites which are in no way part of reddit, and not purged just because a comment is deleted.

Overall, people are worrying way too much about this reddit IPO.  Reddit is valued high right now, partly due to what's happened with GME this year.  Reddit had investors early on, and those investors are going to want a return on their investment.  Reddit was going to IPO at some point, and there is no reason to believe that this IPO is some subversive way for reddit to somehow quell the rebellion.

People need to relax and think more broadly about this, and stop assuming any and everything is related to GME.

If you're really worried about the DD, download it all, rename it, put it into an encrypted zip file, and put it on a bunch of free servers all over the internet.  Pass it around to friends to hold on their computers, or put it on some USB drives.  If it gets taken down, there are likely thousands among the millions that have a backup of it somewhere.",t3_rsbyv7,1,superstonk
