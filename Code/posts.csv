# [U.S. futures point to slightly higher open as airline stocks slide following cancellations](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/27/us-futures-point-to-mixed-open-as-investors-assess-omicron-variant.html)
*****
> U.S. stock index futures indicated a higher start Monday as markets reopen after the Christmas holiday and investors assess the spread of the omicron Covid-19 variant.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose by about 74 points. S&P 500 futures added 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures ticked up 0.4%.
*****
> Airline stocks fell after a holiday weekend that saw thousands of flights canceled due to Covid-related issues. The rampant spread of the omicron variant led to a staffing shortage at a time when airlines were looking to ramp up their schedules to meet high travel demand.
*****
> United Airlines fell 1.9% in premarket trading, while American Airlines dipped 1.6% and Delta Air Lines was off 1.7%.
*****
> Shares of GoDaddy jumped more than 4% in early morning trading after the Wall Street Journal reported activist investor Starboard Value LP took a 6.5% stake in the domain registrar.
*****
> Investors are looking for a Santa Claus rally to close out a year in which the S&P 500 has gained a whopping 25.8%. The benchmark index historically gains during the Santa Claus rally period — the final five trading days of the current year and the first two of the new year.
*****
> On Thursday, with markets closed Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 196.67 points, or 0.55%, to 35,950.56. The S&P 500 rose 0.62% to 4,725.79 and closed at a record. The 500-stock average sits less than 0.4% from its intraday record high. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.85% to 15,653.37.
*****
> Helping boost sentiment were new studies suggesting that omicron has a lower risk of hospitalization than other Covid variants.
*****
> U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that cases of Covid-19 are likely going to keep surging as the omicron variant rapidly spreads across the globe.
*****
> “Every day it goes up and up. The last weekly average was about 150,000 and it likely will go much higher,” Fauci said on ABC’s “This Week.”
*****
> The U.S. has reported more than 52 million total cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Driving the surge is the omicron variant, which took over as the dominant strain earlier this month.
*****
> A slew of economic data on Thursday last week showed a stable economy with improving labor and spending trends, but inflation at high levels. The Federal Reserve’s closely watched core personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.6% in November from the month prior. Core PCE rose 4.7% year-over-year in November, higher than the 4.5% rate expected.
*****
> On the data front Monday, the Dallas Fed manufacturing index is due out at 10:30 a.m. ET.

# [Stock futures are little changed ahead of key Fed decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-key-fed-decision-.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were little changed in early morning trading on Wednesday as investors readied for Wednesday’s highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision.
*****
> Dow futures gained 8 points. S&P 500 futures were flat, and the Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%.
*****
> The Fed will conclude its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and the public will hear from central bank Chairman Jerome Powell at a 2:30 p.m. ET news conference.
*****
> The Fed is grappling with the highest inflation level in 39 years and the central bank is widely expected to announce an acceleration of the tapering of its bond-buying program, which was put in place during the pandemic to prop up the economy.
*****
> “Investors remain on a buyers strike in front of the FOMC meeting,” Fundstrat’s Tom Lee wrote in a note. “Tapering is not the ‘hawkish pivot’ that ends bull markets, but it is a hawkish pivot relative to the massive easing since the pandemic started. So we think this buyers strike in front of FOMC could turn into a ‘buy the event.’”
*****
> This sets the stage for a dramatic policy shift that will clear the way for a first interest rate hike next year.
*****
> A CNBC Fed Survey predicts the Fed will double the pace of the taper to $30 billion at its December meeting, which would end the $120 billion in monthly asset purchases by about March. The central bank will then hike rates three times in each of the next two years, starting in June 2022, the survey respondents predict.
*****
> “While the chairman is not likely to suggest any specific timeframe for when the funds rate will begin to be lifted, he probably will confirm that some members do want to move more quickly than previously announced in raising interest rates,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.
*****
> “I would not expect the Fed to say much that is not already anticipated by the financial markets,” Paulsen added. “Some of the recent stock market volatility may lessen after this two-day meeting and its press conference is finally concluded.”
*****
> On the political front, congressional Democrats passed a bill raising the debt ceiling, sending it to President Joe Biden early Wednesday just under the wire for when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government would run out of spending power.
*****
> On Tuesday, the major averages slipped, exacerbated by selling in software names like Microsoft and Adobe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 106 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.75%.
*****
> The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.1% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.
*****
> Also hurting sentiment Tuesday was the hotter-than-expected inflation reading for November’s producer price index showing a year-over-year increase of 9.6%, the fastest pace on record. This was above the 9.2% expected by economists, according to Dow Jones. The index rose 0.8% month over month, above the 0.5% expected.
*****
> While the Fed meeting is in focus, investors are also monitoring the new Covid variant omicron. The World Health Organization on Tuesday warned the new Covid-19 omicron variant is spreading faster than any previous strain, and is likely in most countries of the world.
*****
> November’s retail sales data is slated to release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting that retail sales rose 0.8% in November, compared to October’s growth of 1.7%, according to the Commerce Department.

Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday, December 13th, 2021-

# [S&P 500 looks set to add to its record close from Friday with futures higher](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> S&P 500 futures rose early Monday after the index notched its best week since February at a fresh record close, rebounding from a big sell-off triggered by fears of the omicron coronavirus variant.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded 40 points higher, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures inched up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.34%.
*****
> Moderna shares were among the strongest gainers premarket Monday, rising 2.4% a day after the White House’s top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci called Covid booster shots “optimal care,” but said the definition of fully vaccinated would not change.
*****
> Elsewhere, Apple moved closer in its quest to become the market’s first $3 trillion company, gaining 1% premarket following an upgrade from JP Morgan.
*****
> Also, chipmaker Nvidia, which has become a signature reopening trade, was up 1.7% on optimism that omicron would not be as disruptive as initially thought.
*****
> The early Monday action followed a strong week on Wall Street as investors shrugged off a hot inflation reading. The blue-chip Dow gained 4% last week, breaking a four-week losing streak with its best weekly performance since March. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively, last week, both posting their best weekly performance since early February.
*****
> Investors digested a jump in headline inflation data, which came in at 6.8% in November year-over-year for the biggest surge since 1982. The print was marginally higher than the 6.7% Dow Jones estimate.
*****
> “The fact is that inflation is likely to remain on the higher side for a while and risks of sticky inflation remain, although we believe that the passing of base effects and the easing of supply chain constraints by the end of the first quarter of next year should slowly bring inflation down to more comfortable levels,” Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in a note.
*****
> The key inflation reading came ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting this week where the policymakers are expected to discuss speeding up the end of its bond-buying program.
*****
> Fed Chair Jerome Powell, as well as a parade of Fed speakers, all recently suggested the central bank could end the $120 billion monthly bond purchase program sooner than the current timeline of June 2022.
*****
> “We believe markets can continue take a higher inflation reading in their stride, though additional volatility remains a risk. With Fed policy staying relatively accommodative, the backdrop for equities is still positive, and we favor winners from global growth,” said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer of UBS Global Wealth Management.
*****
> Stocks bounced back last week as investors bet that the initial worry about the Covid strain is overblown. Many also took solace in the news from Pfizer and BioNTech that a study found three doses of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the variant.
*****
> As of Sunday, the U.S. was approaching 800,000 coronavirus-related deaths. The new variant has pushed some government officials to reinstate health restrictions to slow the spread.

# [Stock futures slip lower ahead of key inflation data, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures were marginally lower during morning trading Tuesday after the major averages started the week in the red as Covid omicron fears hit sentiment.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 futures declined 0.13% while and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by nearly 0.5%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced between gains and losses.
*****
> Tesla shares were among the biggest early droppers on the S&P 500, falling 2.3% premarket after CEO Elon Musk announced that that he has sold another $906.5 million in shares.
*****
> Fellow automaker Ford also fell, down 2.2% following news that by 2030 Toyota would be investing $35 billion into battery-powered electronic vehicles, a space where Ford has sought to establish itself as a leader. Toyota itself declined even more, with shares off 3.4% premarket.
*****
> Pfizer shares rose nearly 1% after final results of tests on its Covid drug showed it reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 89% in high-risk patients.
*****
> The market will get fresh inflation data Tuesday when November’s producer price index number is reported. Economists are expecting it to show that prices rose 0.5% for the month, according to estimates from Dow Jones. This would be a slight slowdown from October’s 0.6% increase.
*****
> The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.
*****
> Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday that he thinks the central bank should start raising rates soon.
*****
> “The Federal Reserve would be better off storing away some of rate increases, so when the inevitable turn down comes, you’ve got some ammunition to fight with,” he said. “At the moment, at zero interest rates, we have no ammunition.”
*****
> Investors will be watching closely for commentary around if the Fed plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank’s asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.
*****
> “So far the bond market has given the Fed a pass on inflation — whether it will continue to do so is in doubt,” noted Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. “The real fireworks coming from the meeting are likely to be around expectations for rate hikes in 2022,” he added.
*****
> The latest CNBC Fed Survey showed that investment professionals and economists expect the Fed to wind down its asset purchases by March and begin rate hikes in June.
*****
> During trading Monday, the Dow slid 0.89%, or 320 points, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.39% as investors rotated out of technology stocks with high valuations.
*****
> Shares of airlines and cruise line operators declined amid fears that the omicron variant could slow travel.
*****
> While equities fell broadly on Monday, growth areas of the market underperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF dipped 1.22%, while the iShares Russell 1,000 Value ETF declined 0.45%.
*****
> Despite Monday’s decline for equities, the S&P 500 is roughly 1.6% below its Nov. 22 all-time intraday high. The Dow is 2.5% below its record, while the Nasdaq Composite is about 5% under its high-water mark. The Russell 2000 index is down a sharper 11.3% since its Nov. 8 high.
*****
> Looking forward, some strategists, including LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick, believe there’s upside ahead for equities.
*****
> “We believe pent-up demand, gradual improvement in supply chain challenges, solid labor force growth, and productivity gains will all contribute to another year of above-trend economic growth in 2022,” he wrote in a note to clients. “COVID-19-related risks remain and the potential for a policy mistake may be elevated as the economy moves towards normalization, but we think the overall environment will be supportive of business growth and ultimately equity markets,” he added.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/StockMarket?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, December 14th, 2021! :)**"
5,5,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, December 17, 2021",14,ris5xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ris5xl/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_friday_december/,24,1639778965.0," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 17, 2021**

Stocks extended Thursday’s losses, with the market ending a volatile week in the red as market participants continued to digest ongoing risk surrounding the Omicron variant and the Fed’s new monetary policy, which signaled a faster rate of taper and interest rate hikes next year. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.02%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.50%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.42%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.92% 
* Volatility Index: +3.19%
* JP Morgan (JPM): -2.28%
* Oracle (ORCL): -6.39%
* AMC: +19.22%
* FedEx (FDX): 4.95%
* Rivian (RIVN): -10.26%

The main focus of market participants remains on the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision, with the Central Bank doubling the pace of tapering and suggestions that the interest rate may be raised three times in 2022.

The potential for higher rates continues to weigh heavily on technology and growth stocks whose valuations rely heavily on future earnings potential. In the last month, the Nasdaq has fallen by -3.43% and the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 8.32% in the last month.

On the other hand, cyclical stocks in the energy and financials sectors outperformed on Thursday, with the prospects of higher interest rates and stronger growth seen as benefiting these sectors. The Dow Jones (DIA) has only lost -1.23% in the month and has been trending upwards in December. As always, it’s important to balance a portfolio with both growth and value stocks.

Troy Gayeski, Chief Market Strategist at F5 Investments, said “The thing investors have to understand is, we're going through a major transition in monetary policy. The Fed has been running emergency policies arguably far longer than they should have been, and as that money supply growth slows down as they ease off the balance sheet expansion and ultimately hike next year, one would at least expect more volatility in markets. And that's really what we've been seeing the last month."" 

**Highlights** 

* The Biden administration on Friday recommended the Federal Communications Commission grant Alphabet's Google and Facebook-parent Meta licenses for an undersea cable.
* The companies entered into national security agreements to protect data on the Pacific Light Cable Network system, an undersea fiber optic cable system that will connect the United States, Taiwan and the Philippines.
* Tesla Inc was hit by a lawsuit over CEO Elon Musk's social media posts including his Twitter poll on stock sales that pulled down its stock prices. Investor David Wagner called for access to internal documents to investigate whether Tesla and Musk failed to adhere to fiduciary duties
* Rivian stock gapped down another roughly 11%  after the company reported earnings that showed steep losses and said it expects to fall “a few hundred vehicles short of its 1,200 production target for this year.
* Alibaba Deputy CFO Toby Xu, making his first major public remarks since being named this month to take over as CFO, said that international e-commerce ""will become one of the key growth drivers"", adding that 57% of revenue for Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics unit, comes from overseas.
* Reddit announced it was filing for an IPO with an estimated $15 billion valuation. I love the platform but I think they’ll have a hard time monetizing users.
* Rivian also announced it was planning to build a new factory in Georgia in order to boost production
* Kellogg’s has reached a new tentative agreement with its 1,400 striking cereal plant workers that could bring an end to the strike that began Oct. 5."

# [Stock futures little changed after the Dow notches a record close](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mixed in early morning trading Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a record close the previous day as investors flocked to shares that stand to benefit from an economic recovery.
*****
> Futures on the blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 were flat, while Nasdaq 100 futures moved 0.3% lower.
*****
> Early losers included Dow component Salesforce, which fell more than 2% in premarket trading following a downgrade from UBS, which also cut Adobe, sending its shares down 1.8%.
*****
> Markets also faced pressure from stocks associated with the economic reopening: Wynn Resorts fell 2%, while Las Vegas Sands was off 1.5%. With Covid cases rising, pharma companies were under pressure, with Regeneron down 3% following a downgrade from Bank of America.
*****
> The moves come as investors look for clues on where the economy stood heading into the new year.
*****
> ADP will be out with its monthly private payrolls count at 8:15 a.m., with the Dow Jones estimate at 375,000 for December. That report will come ahead of Friday’s more closely watched nonfarm payrolls count, which is expected to show a gain of 422,000.
*****
> Investors also awaited the release of minutes from the December Federal Reserve meeting. Policymakers decided then to accelerate the pace of the monthly bond buying taper and indicated that three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes are coming in 2022. They also adjusted their outlook on inflation and economic growth.
*****
> However, the market will be looking for additional information on where officials see policy heading, particularly on what will happen with the Fed’s nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
> On Tuesday, while the Dow climbed 200 points to a new high, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite suffered a sell-off, down 1.3%, amid a rapid rise in Treasury yields. The closely-watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was as high as 1.71% Tuesday, triggering selling in growth-oriented technology stocks.
*****
> Megacap tech stocks underperformed the S&P 500 Tuesday as “investors reconsidered the value of such long-duration assets in the wake of higher rates,” Chris Hussey, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said in a note.
*****
> “The Fed is accelerating its removal of liquidity because inflation has broadened, which has the potential to push 10-year yields higher,” Ed Al-Hussainy, senior rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle, said in a note. “But the central bank must be careful not to act too aggressively, which could derail the economic recovery and cause a recession.”
*****
> Wall Street strategists are expecting a bumpier road ahead for the stock market as the Fed begins to tighten its ultra-easy monetary policy. The median year-end target for the S&P 500 now stands at 5,050, only a 5% gain from Tuesday’s close of 4,793.54, according to CNBC’s Strategist Survey.

Officials discussed reducing the Fed’s balance sheet in another move to dial back its pandemic-era easy monetary policy.
*****
> Bank of America saw its shares increase 1.5% premarket and Citigroup rose 1.4% and Wells Fargo gained 1.3%.
*****
> The Fed’s plan to reduce the number of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities it holds comes as it is already tapering its bond purchases and is set to hike interest rates after the taper concludes.
*****
> “Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate,” the minutes stated.
*****
> Stocks slid following the release of the minutes. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 392.54 points, or 1.07%, lower after hitting an intraday record earlier in the session. The S&P 500 fell 1.94%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw its biggest one-day loss since February, losing 3.34%.
*****
> The Fed update also pushed the 10-year yield to above 1.75%. It ended last year at 1.51%.
*****
> “If you ride a wave of liquidity to the upside and that liquidity starts to go away, I don’t think it’s terribly surprising that you’re going to see a reaction,” said Kathy Jones, head of fixed income at Charles Schwab.
*****
> “This was the year we were going to transition from extremely easy monetary policy and fiscal policy to less easy monetary and less expansive fiscal policy. That has to have some impact on risk assets that have risen because the discount rate was so low,” Jones added.
*****
> All 11 S&P 500 sectors fell in Wednesday’s session.
*****
> Elsewhere Thursday, shares of Allbirds rallied more than 4% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the shoe brand, whose stock has struggled since it went public in November. Also, crypto exchange Coinbase rose nearly 1% following a Bank of America upgrade that said the company is broadening its business.
*****
> Investors await quarterly earnings reports from Walgreens Boots Alliance and Bed Bath & Beyond before the bell Thursday.
*****
> On the data front, the weekly jobless claims report is slated for released Thursday morning. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect that claims totaled 195,000 for the week ended Jan. 1. Trade balance data is also due, with economists looking for the deficit in goods and services to total $81.5 billion.
*****
> The releases come a day ahead of the Labor Department’s key nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show that the economy added 422,000 jobs in December. However, payroll processing firm ADP reported Wednesday that companies added a much higher-than-expected 807,000 positions for the month, indicating a possible upside surprise to Friday’s count from the department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.

# [Dow futures up 200 points following Fed decision to aggressively wind down asset purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/stock-futures-market-open-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose sharply in early Thursday trading after the Federal Reserve signaled it would be aggressive on tapering and sees three interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped about 222 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.7% each.
*****
> Shares of companies that have done well in previous rate-hiking cycles led premarket gainers. Materials stocks FMC Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan both rose more than 3% ahead of the opening bell. Bank stocks also rose across the board, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America all up about 0.6%.
*****
> In transportation news, Delta Air Lines reported that it now expects to see a profit of $200 million in the fourth quarter, after previously projecting a loss. Shares rose 2.2% on the news.
*****
> In other central banking news, the Bank of England announced it is hiking its key policy rate by 15 basis points to 0.25%. Markets were awaiting a separate policy decision from the European Central Bank. There also is more economic news on tap, with weekly jobless claims and housing starts out at 8:30 a.m. ET.
*****
> Following the Fed news, traders accelerated their own expectations for interest rate increases. Fed funds futures trading now points to a 63% chance of the first quarter-percentage-point increase coming in May 2022, with chances also rising to about 44% that the central bank could make its first move as soon as March, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
*****
> Stocks traded in negative territory throughout the regular session Wednesday and turned higher ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference in the afternoon at the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Dow added 383 points, or 1.08%. The S&P 500 rose 1.63% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.15%.
*****
> “The fact that the FOMC acknowledged new COVID variants as a threat to the economic recovery that could alter policy going forward, as well as the generally optimistic tone from Powell in the presser, helped spark a relief rally as the Fed meeting was viewed as being not-as-hawkish-as-feared,” Tom Essaye of the Sevens Report said in a note on Thursday.
*****
> The Fed will begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases in January and buy just $60 billion of bonds each month going forward, compared to $90 billion in the month of December. That decision follows recent inflation data showing a 6.8% surge in November, which is higher than expected and the fastest rate since 1982.
*****
> “The notion that elevated inflation levels would be transitory has finally been thrown out the window by the Fed and the latest policy adjustments are reflective of a committee that doesn’t want to miss the next train leaving the station,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
*****
> Health-care stocks UnitedHealth and Amgen gained ground Wednesday, rising 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively.
*****
> Adobe and Accenture are scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the opening bell. FedEx and Rivian will report after the bell.

*****
> U.S. stocks were poised to build on record highs in the final week of the year as futures rose Tuesday morning.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added about 90 points, while those for the S&P 500 gained 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 were up 0.5%.
*****
> The move in futures comes after stocks rallied in Monday’s regular session, with the S&P 500 rising roughly 1.4% to close at a record high. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4%, while the Dow climbed about 352 points.
*****
> Markets continued to look to pandemic news for direction.
*****
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Monday that it was shortening its isolation recommendation for people who test positive to five days from 10, if those people do not have symptoms.
*****
> Research out of South Africa also indicated that omicron infections can help boost immunity to the earlier delta strain of Covid.
*****
> Pharmaceutical stocks dipped in early trading following the relatively optimistic news on the pandemic. Moderna slipped 1.6% and Pfizer was marginally lower in light premarket trading Tuesday morning.
*****
> Stocks dipped in late November, in part because of the rise of the omicron variant of Covid-19, but have since rebounded as governments have largely shied away from reinstating lockdowns and strict social distancing measures.
*****
> Airline stocks did struggle on Monday, however, as the spread of the virus led to hundreds of flight cancelations around the Christmas holiday. Apple also announced that it was closing its New York City stores to customers due to the spike in Covid cases.
*****
> Stocks tend to rise in light trading during the final days of the year, often called the “Santa Claus rally.” However, many Wall Street pros predict relatively small gains for stocks in 2022 after two strong years.
*****
> “If you look around Wall Street, you see very tame expectations, and it’s probably a reflection that we’re probably pretty late in the cycle,” Jim Lacamp, senior vice president at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said on “Closing Bell.”
*****
> In addition to the S&P 500′s record close, the Dow is within 1% of its intraday all-time high, while the Nasdaq is about 2% below its high-water mark.
*****
> For the year, the S&P 500 is up 27.6% for the year and the Nasdaq is up 23.1%. The Dow is the laggard, up 18.6%.
*****
> It is a slow week overall for economic data, but investors will get a look at home prices on Tuesday when the October reading for the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index is released before the bell.

bis zu meinem 52. Lebensjahr (ja, es gibt echt so alte Leute hier) hatte ich weder Geld zum Investieren an der Börse, noch wäre ich bereit gewesen, meine sauerverdienten Spargroschen wie ein Grosskapitalist vermehren zu wollen. 

Aktien? Teufelszeug! Ausbeutung! Leistungsloses Einkommen! Pfui Deibel. 🤮

Das einzige, in das ich als Alleinerziehende einen Arsch voll Geld investiert habe, das war die Ausbildung meiner beiden Mädels. Dafür haben sie mir einen Platz in einem schicken Altersheim mit See- oder Flussblick versprochen, nebst knackigem Personal-Pfleger. 👩‍🦼🕺🏻Ein guter Deal, wie ich finde. 

Natürlich ist mir klar, dass das ein hochriskantes Geschäft ist, wer weiss, ob sich die Plagen dereinst an das Geschäft erinnern werden. Vielleicht werde ich ja dement und ich vergesse am Ende selbst, dass ich doch eigentlich auf Kosten meiner Kinder meinen Lebensabend in der Luxusdependance mit Hummer und Champagner verbringen sollte, während ich in Wirklichkeit in einem Stift für alte Damen lande, wo ich mich mich über Haferschleimsuppe und Klatschkreise bei Schlagermusik jubeln sähe  - obwohl ich doch schon mein ganzes Leben lang Metal-Fan bin. 

Just also, als ich beginne, mir über Rente usw. Gedanken zu machen, stolpere ich über Berichte zur verbotenen Aktie. 

Was ich da lese, erfreut mein Herz, das bei mir selbst dann links schlagen würde, wenn es rechts sässe. 

Eine Horde Kleinanleger zockte demnach die Finanzhaie ab, schlägt das System mit seinen Waffen. Jaja, die Zeitungen schreiben viel, wenn der Tag lang ist, vor allem Mist. Aber systemkritische Revolution und gleichzeitig auf Kosten der Reichen auch reich werden, ha!, die Idee gefiel mir, auch wenn sie zu schön klang, um von mir tatsächlich geglaubt zu werden. 

Vielmehr wurde mir einfach klar, dass ich etwas für meine Altersvorsorge tun musste und dass es an der Zeit wäre, den Tatsachen ins Auge zu sehen: In meinem Alter wird man nicht mehr von Millionären geheiratet, Lotto spielen wird auch nix bringen, es bleibt nur der Kapitalismus. 

Flugs eröffnete ich ein Depot in der Handelsrepublik und verlor erst mal, ganz so, wie es sich gehört, reichlich Geld mit Aktien, weil ich natürlich alle Anfängerfehler mitnahm, die man machen konnte. 
Zu hoch rein, Panikverkäufe, die ganze Klaviatur des Versagens. 

Ehrlich gesagt, da packte mich die Wut auf meine eigene Dämlichkeit und ich mich selbst bei der Ehre. 

Ich erinnerte mich an die Artikel über die Kleinanlegerrevolution, da stand irgendwas von so einer Art Insider-Forum namens „Reddit“. Dazu muss man wissen: Ich bin weder bei Insta, auch nicht bei Facebook und wenn ich TikTok höre, dann denke ich, es klopft jemand an die Tür. Ich erstellte mir dennoch einen Account und fand mich als u/silvaggia unter anderem bei r/finanzen wieder. Du liebe Güte,  das war nicht meine Welt. Ich wollte ganz sicher nicht trockene Spaghetti futtern, um drei Tage früher in Rente gehen zu dürfen. 

So führte mich der Weg schnurstraks in die Mauerstrasse. 

Nachdem ich mich bei der Umfrage, in der wir gemeinsam und vor allem höchst freiwillig u/ifaqyurmama zum beliebtesten Mod kürten, als wohl älteste Bewohnerin der Mauerstrasse geoutet hatte, wurde mir das Flair „MSW-Omi“  verliehen. Und ich kann sagen, ich trug es mit Stolz! 

Ich hebelte, was das Zeug hielt, verlor, gewann - wie es sich für eine ordentliche Mauerstrassenwettlerin gehört. Ich freute mich über den regen Austausch im Daily, über lustige Maimas und vor allem darüber: Niemand nahm scheinbar Anstoss daran, dass ich tatsächlich noch viel älter als der Ritter war. 

Bis zu dem Tag, an dem in einem Daily jemand die Frage stellte, wer wohl der dümmste User hier im Unter sei. Neugierig, wie alte Frauen halt so sind, klickte ich auf die Verlinkung - und landete auf meinem eigenen Profil. 

Schockstarre. 😱Ich hatte mich sauwohl hier gefühlt. Dass ich, die in ihrer analogen Welt als durchaus belesen und halbwegs intelligent gilt, auf die junge Generation ganz offensichtlich - siehe Verlinkung - dumm wirkte, das hatte mich tatsächlich getroffen. Und das fanden wohl auch andere, der Beitrag wurde reichlich gelikt. Dumme alte Gans, scholt ich mich, das kommt davon, wenn man einfach nicht einsehen mag, dass man alt und peinlich wird. Ich weinte ein paar Tränen in mein Kopfkissen und löschte meinen Account. Ende 1. Akt.

2. Akt
Nach einiger Zeit in der ich nur heimlich hier rumluscherte, entschloss ich mich, mich neu anzumelden. Gesagt, getan. Just zu dieser Zeit ergab es sich, das wieder die Frage nach dem dümmsten User gestellt wurde. Da ich das ja nicht mehr sein konnte, mein alter Account war ja gelöscht, klickte ich extrem gespannt auf die Verlinkung, um zu schauen, wer denn nun meine Nachfolge angetreten habe. 

Und ich landete, Ihr werdet es ahnen, wieder auf meinem Profil. 

Es dauerte einen Moment, bis ich begriff: Der Link führte ausnahmslos jeden auf das jeweils eigene Profil. 😵‍💫🤯🙈

Ja, da war er, der ultimative Beweis: Ich war wirklich mit Abstand der dümmste User bzw die dümmste Userin dieses Unters. 

😹😹😹😹😹😹😹

Ich will nun diese Feststellung dazu nutzen, all jenen, die hier in der letzten Zeit Verluste gemacht und viel Geld verloren haben, sagen: Schaut her: Egal wie dumm Ihr Euch deswegen fühlt, verliert nicht den Mut. Wenn die dümmste Userin des Unters es schafft, bummelig 50% 

https://imgur.com/a/SmN0G4f

in knapp einem Jahr zu machen, dann schafft Ihr das auch. 

Fragt mich bitte nicht nach meiner Stategie. Ich hab‘ keine. Wäre ich weniger dumm gewesen, dann könnten da auch 100% stehen, denn ich habe tatsächlich auch viel Geld verloren mit Puts und Calls auf Biontech und auf den Nasdaq oder zB, weil ich so doof war, günstig gekaufte Aktien aus dem Bereich Psychedelic Drugs, auf den ich z. B. langfristig wirklich grosse Hoffnung setze, über den IPO hinaus zu halten, statt die fetten Gewinne mitzunehmen und später wieder einzusteigen.

Aus jedem Fehltrade habe ich allerdings gelernt und letztlich hat sich das ausgezahlt - >50% EOY. Ich habe Ende letzter Woche weitgehend ausgecasht und warte jetzt mit Euch auf den Weltuntergang. Je nachdem, was der Opa von drüben postuliert, steige ich langsam wieder ein. 

Dass ich doch noch ganz gut performt habe, verdanke ich auch Euch, liebe Nachbarn und Nachbarinnen hier aus der Mauerstrasse, Eurem Wissen, ja, auch Euren Fehlern. Und das weiss ich zu schätzen. Ihr seid eine tolle Truppe! Deshalb möchte ich auch hier um Entschuldigung bitten, geglaubt zu haben, ich sei hier altersbedingt nicht gelitten. Das war wirklich saudummst. 

Und wenn es nicht ganz so unverschämt wirkt, dann hätte ich gerne mein Flair als MSW-Omi zurück, u/ifaqyurmama. 

Danke vorab, auch im Namen meiner Eltern. 🙏

13,0,We need to lock the float before Reddit goes public.,1285,rk1ti6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/rk1ti6/we_need_to_lock_the_float_before_reddit_goes/,128,1639936285.0,"Title. 

I think if SHFs are able to buy reddit and can somehow affect censorship of the GME subs, the most impactful move they can make will be to shut down communication about DRS. I believe this is our biggest threat. 

Everyone knows to buy and hold. Fewer people know, or are willing, to DRS without a lot more information to make that choice easier. If SHFs are able to exert control over these subreddits in any way, you can bet your jacked tits that DRS posts and conversations will be much more restricted or potentially banned. 

Cutting out our primary way of discussing/helping each other DRS will be extremely detrimental to our DRS efforts and I think we would slow down dramatically at that point. 

Locking the float will take months, so will this IPO. We're currently ahead in the race, but we shouldn't risk anything. If DRS makes sense to you, there's no time to waste. Don't give them the opportunity to implement whatever evil shit they're cooking up right now. 

Who gives a fuck about anything on this sub besides DRS and a marketplace launch announcement at this point. DRS is within our control and it can fuck them but we don't have unlimited time. 

**Go DRS so fucking hard** (if you want). Ok thanks I love you bye."
14,1,Ryan Cohen: Why this guy just fucks and a look into his past may tell the future,1249,res9ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/res9ps/ryan_cohen_why_this_guy_just_fucks_and_a_look/,68,1639325941.0,"    This text was originally written in German and only quickly thrown into the translator. So won't be surprised if the grammar is wrong in some places.     

[\\""Talk is cheap, it takes money to buy whiskey\\"" - Ryan Cohen](https://preview.redd.it/msihkstty4581.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6cb6c06d26b3498ac6f8f9620a5984f79461876)

Ryan Cohen was the CEO of Chewy, an e-commerce company specializing in pets, which he founded when he was just 25 years old. In 2017, he sold Chewy to PetSmart in a $3.3 billion deal to pursue other personal goals.

Then Ryan Cohen's investor side began to gain notoriety. After selling Chewy, he invested his money in only two companies Apple and Wells Fargo. In Apple, he even became the largest single investor with about 6 million shares.

By the end of 2020, Cohen had also become GameStop's largest single shareholder after acquiring 10% of GME's stock and subsequently increasing his stake to about 13%. These investments were made before the extraordinary price explosion in GameStop stock in late January 2021. Shortly thereafter in April, he was named charmain of the board of directors. (Excerpt from [TheStreet article](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/gme/gamestop-stock-understanding-the-ryan-cohen-factor))

Ryan Cohen articulates his investment approach as follows:

>It's very hard, at least for me, to find great ideas. When I find something I'm really convinced of, I go all-in. (Excerpt from [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo))

However, when Ryan Cohen started Chewy in 2011, he was rejected by most investors....

>**Friedman:** You were rejected by 100 different investors. What did you learn from that process? What made you keep going when you kept hearing no?  
>  
>**Cohen:** To me, every no sounded like they just didn't understand my vision. That was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those ""no's"" never made me doubt my strategy - quite the opposite. All the rejections motivated me, and they only spurred me on. (Excerpt from [Forbes interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=5f5a6f355840))

He goes on to say that

>**Cohen:** Most investors couldn't overcome two hurdles: direct competition with Amazon and the failure of [pets.com](https://pets.com/) during the dot-com bubble. However, I believed that focusing on the pets category, along with highly personalized customer service, gave Chewy unique competitive advantages. [Pets.com](https://pets.com/) was a good idea, but a decade too early and not big enough to cover its costs. Those two hurdles didn't deter me. I never thought of changing my business plan. A highly respected venture capitalist once told me that he would be more interested if we sold live pets over the Internet rather than pet supplies. Like most investors, he thought it would be suicidal to get in Amazon's way. (Excerpt from [Forbes interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=5f5a6f355840))

How he managed to slam Amazon with Chewy anyway he tells here....

>**Cohen:** I focused on bringing a human element to e-commerce. We offered 24/7 customer service in the U.S. and relied on small touches like handwritten vacation cards and personalized pet portraits. This allowed us to connect with our customers and retain them for the long term by aiming for a lifelong relationship, not just a single order. In 2018, 90% of our sales came from repeat customers. The secret to Chewy was the relationship with customers. I realized that one big thought along the way was likely to be misunderstood. I'm a contrarian by nature (\*probably not the most appropriate term in current covid times), and when I'm misunderstood, it's often an affirmation of what I'm doing. It wasn't until Chewy boxes started appearing on front doors across the country that the majority of investors recognized our formula. (Excerpt from [Forbes interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=5f5a6f355840))

It's worth noting that [GameStop has the largest digital magazine subscription in the world with ""Game Informer""](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Informer) and 55 million PowerUp members are registered with GameStop. Someone like Ryan Cohen can capitalize on this by focusing on customer service and customer experience. You can tell he has a strong penchant for customer loyalty.

# Who Ryan Cohen is working with and how he took over GameStop

The following information comes from the really great[researched report](https://gmedd.com/opinion/who-is-ryan-cohen-working-with/) from [GMEdd.com](https://gmedd.com/). I provide you the report only a little bit modified here...

[Since a deal was struck between RC Ventures and GameStop in January 2021](https://gmedd.com/news/rc-ventures-agreement-reached/), Ryan Cohen has been working almost exclusively behind the scenes to transform the company, though it's not known who he consults with on strategic moves. By looking at Cohen's past and the footprints he's left behind, [GMEdd.com](https://gmedd.com/) is able to make a few educated guesses.

**Chewy's other co-founder**

[Blake’s LinkedIn shows that he was Co-Founder & CTO of Chewy until April 2018, ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbday/)[just a month after it was announced Ryan Cohen would be stepping down as CEO](https://miamiherald.typepad.com/the-starting-gate/2018/03/change-at-the-top-co-founder-ryan-cohen-stepping-down-as-ceo-of-chewy.html). Both Blake and Ryan remained with the company for a year after a [$3B payday from PetSmart in 2017](https://www.vox.com/2017/4/18/15339208/petsmart-chewy-acquisition-price-3-35-billion).

[From past interviews with Ryan Cohen](https://www.inc.com/emily-canal/petsmart-acquires-chewy.html), we know the founders first met through an online Java chat room and shared similar visions for a groundbreaking e-commerce business before starting Chewy.com together, but insight on Blake remains limited beyond this.

In a [TechCrunch interview in 2019](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-on-its-fast-approaching-ipo-its-like-seeing-my-baby-graduate/?guccounter=1), Ryan Cohen was asked,

>Would you partner again with Michael on a different e-commerce business or maybe a venture outfit?

to which Ryan Cohen responded,

>We’re really close. It needs to be the right opportunity obviously, and we need to be picky. But I have no plans to sit in retirement, that’s for sure. I’m 33 and I’m competitive and I like consumer businesses and I like to win.

Ryan is arguably in the midst of his **biggest venture yet**

Although Chewy's headquarters are in Florida, [the company built a small team in Boston](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/01/17/chewy-com-bounds-into-boston/6yYT83yX031PrXaQ0zXwBJ/story.html), initially working in temporary space before leasing its own 20,000-square-foot space in 2017. Cohen says Boston was an attractive location to recruit tech talent:

>Boston is a fantastic tech and startup hub with dozens of universities. There's just a lot of talent here. We looked at all the major U.S. cities when we were planning this office, and Boston was the most competitive. (Excerpted from [Boston Globe article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/01/17/chewy-com-bounds-into-boston/6yYT83yX031PrXaQ0zXwBJ/story.html))

Blake Day, who served as CTO, led the Boston office. He gave an [interview to VentureFizz](https://venturefizz.com/stories/boston/engineering-spotlight-chewy) about the move to Boston, and you could tell he sounds a lot like Cohen:

Samantha Rassner served as Chewy’s Vice President of Software Development from September 2015 to February 2018. [In a LinkedIn blog post on her exit of the company, Samantha Rassner recounts Blake’s visionary speech](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-left-chewy-samantha-rassner/). Blake and Ryan sound one and the same here as well.

**Chewy's first investor**

[Larry Cheng, co-founder and managing partner of Volition Capital](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/members/larry-cheng/), was [the first major investor to back Chewy](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/portfolio/chewy/) after [the company was turned down numerous times by other firms.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/)

Larry’s investment through Volition was key to the growth and expansion of the company, and as a result, Larry and Ryan remain “fast friends.” While GameStop is a different story than Chewy,  it’s not crazy to think that Volition Capital and Larry Cheng have long been involved in mentoring the turnaround based on these facts alone.

https://preview.redd.it/70z29mc2z4581.png?width=462&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab9a270305ea0c185b67d006ad38cca09d3b394a

The timeline and Larry Cheng's seat on GameStop's board suggests **that Volition Capital and Larry Cheng are privy to Ryan's plans and have long been involved in supporting the turnaround**.

https://preview.redd.it/hsi6s7g3z4581.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=232497beeb6141957faec875761908548c13b988

[Ryan Cohen filed his first 13D for GameStop via RC Ventures LLC on August 28, 2020, disclosing an initial 9% stake](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822844/000101359420000670/rc13d-082820.htm). This sparked waves, particularly within value investor circles, as many pondered the E-commerce guru’s investment motives.

What few realize is that Cohen didn’t initially invest in August 2020, but much earlier in April 2019. This can be deduced from the [initial 13D](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822844/000101359420000670/rc13d-082820.htm), through share counts and averages based on implied price. [Rod Alzmann of GMEdd.com](https://gmedd.com/rod) states that when he inquired with GameStop last year, investor relations confirmed that Cohen had held $GME since April 2019. 

https://preview.redd.it/9a9lx655z4581.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6fef39300da5fb091eff825242734d52cc2d38f

Just one week after Ryan’s public disclosure, on September 4th, 2020, Volition Capital published an insight piece titled[ *Gaming as a Service and Why it Matters,*](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/gaming-as-a-service-and-why-it-matters/) authored by one of the firm’s associates, Claude de Jocas. This also appears to be the [first piece of gaming related research the firm has released.](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/gaming-as-a-service-and-why-it-matters/)

Over the next few weeks, [Ryan added to his position twice more until reaching a 9.98% stake, disclosed September 21](https://sec.report/Document/0001013594-20-000699/). Weeks later, on October 9, Volition released a video where Claude de Jocas discusses the[ future of internet gaming and its growth potential.](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/video-the-future-of-internet-gaming-with-claude-de-jocas/)

Skip ahead just one month, and on November 17, Ryan filed an amendment to his 13D [with an attached letter to the GameStop board urging the company to share a credible plan for seizing opportunities in the rapidly growing gaming sector.](https://gmedd.com/rc/ryan-cohen-urges-strategic-review-in-letter-to-the-board/)

**PR Blitz**

Ryan Cohen was far from being a household name in August of 2020 when he filed his initial stake in GameStop, so many investors started researching him to get a feel for what his plan was.[ At the time, Ryan had established a website, ryan-cohen.com, that embedded various media appearances and formal interviews the Chewy co-founder had given, but it has since been shut down in December of 2020.](https://web.archive.org/web/20201214000353/https://ryan-cohen.com/)

Had the website done its job? 

https://preview.redd.it/1e6tnz3fz4581.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2358e9f86124408e7a0d9ca53689dedac2e71bc

[Retail investing icon Roaring Kitty first stumbles upon Ryan Cohen’s rudimentary homepage during an August 28th, 2020 livestream.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Af9T8TU2OM?t=1950) At the time, the deep value investor was merely trying to learn more about the Chewy founder. Most of the content was posted on the site between mid-2019, around Chewy’s IPO and Cohen’s initial GameStop investment, and mid-2020.

Investors could speculate that this may have been [a coordinated PR blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_campaign) campaign [before revealing a large stake in a public company](https://gmedd.com/rc), one that he had already been discreetly acquiring.

Each interview Cohen conducted provided valuable insight into his business strategy, and much of how he described Chewy’s story and his vision could also be applied to GameStop. Was this intentional? [In one September 2019 post on Medium, when asked about what’s next, Ryan hinted at something being on the horizon](https://medium.com/authority-magazine/chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-we-put-together-a-team-that-was-obsessed-with-delighting-our-customers-e8cacbd0477b).

https://preview.redd.it/5jxbi2ihz4581.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=55f483e6a65f15b3ffdcaf6dcf2374b49cb8238a

>I\`m only 34, so i certainly haven\`t peaked as an entrepreneur yet. Stay tuned.

Okay, where were we? [Ryan Cohen started buying into GameStop in April of 2019, with a disclosure following increased holdings in August 2020.](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-gme-gamestop-rc-ventures-llc-sc-13d-2020-august-28-18503) It’s unknown as to when he made the decision and how much time was spent beforehand figuring out activist investor logistics coinciding with a PR blitz, **but it is reasonable to assume he was strategically building public-facing credibility for himself before revealing his high-stakes investment**.

Fast forward to 2021, [Ryan Cohen now owns 12.9% of GameStop](https://gmedd.com/rc/ryan-cohen-increases-stake/), joins the board, an extraordinary price explosion in late January generated national coverage of GameStop, prompting a series of [congressional hearings](https://gmedd.com/regulatory/gamestop-hearing-scheduled/), and suddenly everyone knows about [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/).

https://preview.redd.it/8keeaojiz4581.png?width=440&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5a6576010eb85df8adf46a1139676bddc8283c4

Amid all of this attention, the company remains quiet but starts undergoing rapid transformation, which was initially visible from the Investor Relations page, but now only seen through [activity on LinkedIn](https://gmedd.com/opinion/gamestop-poaches-talent-from-the-best/) — there have been over 30 new hires in tech and E-commerce positions starting in February, [just a month after Cohen joined the GameStop board.](https://gmedd.com/news/rc-ventures-agreement-reached/)

**Strategic Advisory**

[On March 2nd, 2021, Volition Capital launched a new Strategic Advisory Board](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/volition-capital-launches-strategic-advisory-board-underscores-commitment-to-accelerate-portfolio-company-success/) that, “will provide focused guidance to the firm and its portfolio companies regarding strategic direction, investments, executive hiring and development, due-diligence, network and operational strategy, among other areas.” Volition states that the firm had been working on assembling this board for almost a year.

So a venture firm launched a strategic advisory board. Who cares?

[Wait, that name is familiar…](https://www.volitioncapital.com/strategic-advisory-board/#blake-day)

https://preview.redd.it/qjp3oo4lz4581.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ee0bd9f84fcea958c8e06d9137a33348783ea5

As of March 2021, Blake is now at the helm of Volition’s Strategic Advisory Board. Blake has l**argely laid low since his Chewy departure** and [still lives in Fort Lauderdale](https://gmedd.com/transformation/gamestop-hints-at-new-florida-office/) according to his Volition Capital bio.

This appears to be the first public role he has taken since leaving Chewy in 2018. ***Cohen*****cidence?**

Volition’s second listed Strategic Advisory Board Member is [Raul Fernandez, ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raul-fernandez-2877404)who serves as[ Vice Chairman and Owner of Monumental Sports & Entertainment](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raul-fernandez-2877404), which is a private partnership of Washington DC’s major sports franchises including eSports teams.

Early GameStop investors will recognize Raul’s name, because they will have seen it before as well.

[GameStop’s May 2020 “Driving Value For All Stockholders”](https://investor.gamestop.com/static-files/09f9491c-d15e-4db2-acab-3a356289db5d) notes that Raul Fernandez serves on GameStop’s board to provide insight into the world of professional eSports on slide 32. 

GameStop claims that [Raul Fernandez was appointed to the board](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-raul-fernandez-and-lizabeth-dunn-board)  under an agreement with *Hestia Capital Partners, L.P.* (“Hestia Capital”) and *Permit Capital Enterprise Fund, L.P.*  (“Permit Capital”), lead by currently outgoing GameStop director and atypical shareholder activist [Kurt Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurt-wolf-b0a412b).

https://preview.redd.it/trf7p5boz4581.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=7638c6e345386ae1051d1cf2d25d7df38c23cc2a

Hestia Capital and Permit Capital, together with their affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 1.3% of GameStop at this point, and Kurt Wolf, as their Managing Partner, had [just sent a letter to GameStop’s board calling for a corporate refresh.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hestia-capital-and-permit-capital-send-letter-to-gamestop-gme-board-of-directors-calling-for-a-refreshed-board-and-stock-tender-offer-of-up-to-700-million-300812140.html)

Wolf had been advocating for GameStop’s board to [adapt to the times and transform from an underperforming retailer into a forward-thinking company that emphasized long-term growth](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hestia-capital-and-permit-capital-send-letter-to-gamestop-gme-board-of-directors-calling-for-a-refreshed-board-and-stock-tender-offer-of-up-to-700-million-300812140.html). He later insists in a May 2020 presentation by Restore that Raul be placed to GameStop's board of directors.

While the GameStop board claimed they began to cooperate with Hestia/Permit in April of 2019, [Ryan Cohen](http://twitter.com/ryancohen) began purchasing his initial position in the gaming retailer.

Fernandez still currently serves on GameStop’s board, and [filings reveal he will be stepping down at the Annual General Meeting on June 9th, ](https://gmedd.com/news/rc-ventures-on-pace-to-control-gamestop-board/)as Ryan Cohen takes the reigns as incoming Chairman of the Board. 

# GameStop's transformation to a technology company

A lot has happened in the nearly 10 months so far since Ryan Cohen was appointed to GameStop's board in February 2021, and it's clear that the transformation is in full swing:

* [GameStop executed two ATM offerings, flushing another $1.7 billion into the company's transformation cash](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-completes-market-equity-offering-program-0)

* [Total of 322 new hires since February](https://gmedd.com/report-model/) for e-commerce, UI, UX, blockchain, operations and supply chain, including 200+ senior management hires coming from leading tech companies. Most of the new hires are from Chewy, Amazon, and Zulily. (It's worth noting that many of the new hires are talking about a one-time opportunity, and even the senior director of Apple Care, who worked there for 10-years, is moving to GameStop. Management also heavily promotes just about everything on LinkedIn)

# Conclusion

You can see that RC really believes in what he is doing. It's a mentality like this why some people say ""invest in the man, not the company"". And I think that saying fits. I have faith in Ryan Cohen! This guy fucks! Similarly with someone like Elon Musk. I don't want to put anyone on a pedestal, but a lot of investors put a lot of blind faith in him because they believe in his vision. It's great when you can combine a great company with a visionary at the helm. That's the cherry on top of a solid investment.

Here's some more fundamental analysis on this....

* ""GameStop is neither an ordinary stock nor a failing retail chain, as Wall Street previously thought."" [Value Analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gamestop-ordinary-stock-nor-failing-brick-and-mortar-retail-michal/?trackingId=ZpbD7gBYSAuidJ3HF2LEeg%3D%3D) by Michal Gregersen (Aspiring portfolio manager & equity trader)
* [Research Report](https://gmedd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GMEdd-GameStopValuation-16Nov21-1.pdf) from [GMEdd.com](https://gmedd.com/)

Furthermore, [since June 23, 2021, not a single insider with more information than anyone else has sold their shares](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1326380.htm). And that was just one person selling since January.

GameStop is the world's largest retailer of video games. With Ryan Cohen as its new chairman and a new, technology-focused board, the company now has unified leadership dedicated to two long-term goals: **""delighting customers and creating value for shareholders.""** 2021 was a watershed year for GameStop, with a strengthened and consolidated financial position ([$1.4 billion cash on hand in Q3](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-financial-results-q3-2021)) and rapidly increasing net sales ([29% growth in Q3](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-financial-results-q3-2021)), the transformation is also well underway.

In addition, GameStop has made a **radical strategic shift**, **expanding its business model** to compete and thrive in the age of mobile gaming and digital downloads, and reinvented itself as a major e-commerce player. Gamestop already has **4,816 stores in 14 countries and over 55 million PowerUp members**. As it continues to develop its e-commerce business and build a mass-market NFT marketplace, the long-term potential of this company is truly great.

And so regardless of the hotly debated MOASS theory, GameStop is an undervalued stock for me to invest in long-term. And I have my shares registered directly in my name (DRS) with Computershare because I hate synthetic/naked shares.

If anything, it is going to Balkanize. It will be ugly and not a good time.**

Few people want to read books on reddit so I am going to keep this one short(er). If you want the long version, I [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/m1duoa/the_united_states_is_following_a_pattern_of/)^1 [them](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/oj18x4/an_examination_of_modern_conflict_an_analysis_of/)^2 [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/oj1al6/an_examination_of_modern_conflict_an_analysis_of/)^3 If you don't like reading, Robert Evans' podcast ""It Could Happen Here"" is a good introduction to these concepts. All sources are linked at the bottom.

Anyway, the term ""civil war"" has been in mainstream new cycle as of late. Of course many people balk at this idea because they cannot imagine this happening. It must be impossible in today's modern world with all its complexities. The problem is that those people still view ""war"" in the way it happened in the 1940s: two big sides, attacks and counter-attacks over lines on a map, money and fuel and infantry on the ground trying to outlast each other, etc. It doesn't work like that. War hasn't worked like that for at least the past 50 years.

The signs of a coming civil collapse can be watered down to four indicators:

**1. Freedom and rights are disappearing.**

The two wings of our neoliberal political system have refused to return liberties to common people and have only intensified their assault on the unalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. Healthcare, the right to one's own body, a living wage allowing one to own a house.

**2. Polarization, hate, and violence are on the rise.**

The 2024 presidential campaign started on January 20, 2021 at 12:00. [White supremacy is now mainstream.](http://archive.vn/INs2W)^4

**3. Access to information is limited.**

An information silo is a business management term for information that is self-contained and walled off from everything else. I'm not getting into business jargon here, so think of it like a grain silo. Yes, that giant tube with a dome on top next to a barn. It's full of grain and on the top you can even stand on it (don't do that). It looks good, sturdy, stable, just like a new theory you are exposed to. But if you start poking around, there are a lot of holes, cavities, voids. If one of those collapses, then you go down. You go down and you're done. Just like that. Or maybe you get chest deep, but then you're still stuck. All of the grain, the little bits of theory, the information is so much pressure on you that can't get out. You can't pull yourself out and people can see you but they can't really help either. If you are thrown a rope and enough people try, then may they pull you out. However, the forces of grain on your body may crush you anyway in the process. The way out takes professional help; someone with the proper tools to build blockers around you, so that the pressure is gone and they can safely move you out.

We have tens of millions of the US population living in alternates realities. These thousands of grains of conspiracy theories and actual foreign propaganda are stuck together through lies and gaslighting, or what is now cutely called ""misinformation"". It has become profitable to keep people in these information silos. [Reddit is about to IPO.](http://archive.vn/Hmoc5)^5 That means that like Facebook and YouTube, it will be flooded with ""fact checkers"" and censures and guidance to keep what is on it appropriate for capital inventors and advertisers.

**4. The behavior of people in the know.**

This is what people are noticing now. People who study extremism saw the writing on the wall at end of 2020. The rest of the country saw it in January 2021. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, took action after the 6th to mitigate the risks of a further self-coup. He even [put out a memo on Jan 12th stating his actions.](http://archive.vn/YFzrL)^6 The people paying attention are [seeing the pattern for what it is.](http://archive.vn/CLaep)^7

## Americanisms

The US will be facing a constitutional crisis. We witnessed a practice violent coup on Jan 6. In a different century, when another angry charismatic man did this, he was barely punished at all and then returned 10 years later with a successful political coup. The political coup is going on right now, in the states of Georgia, Michigan, and Arizona. If the results of the primaries go a certain way, that movement will be re-energized. The coup has not failed yet. It has not stopped.

The US has already fulfilled the 14 points of a certain mode of government. That's old news. The ~~Sturmabteilung~~ Proud Boys (even in their neutered state), the Three Percenters, and the Oath Keepers have no shortage of [able-bodied, reactionary men.](http://archive.vn/0CoEw)^8 

The US is heavily divided through manufactured hatred. It is the tried and true method of divide-and-conquer used to kill a nation. The Germans did it to Namibia. The Dutch did it to South Africa. The Belgians did it to Rwanda. The Brits did it to Afghanistan. Reagan funded it in Yugoslavia. And now it's happening here.

In the scenario that things become kinetic, it is not going to end fast. Every enemy nation and their dog will be doing their damnest to keep the USA in conflict and de-stabilized for as long as possible. And every country that is not an open enemy will be doing their damnest to direct proxy battles and make sure that the power vacuum does not re-fill in the wrong way. There are thousands of reasons to be worried about the most powerful arsenal in human history. The US is far bigger than Germany or Yugoslavia. When it falls, the entire world will suffer.

## Frequently Awful Takes

> It won't happen because no one really wants it to.

The majority of people never want to go to war with their neighbors. Yet history has shown us that all it takes is an extreme vocal minority and a pathetic majority for these things to happen. And when it does happen, people who really don't want to choose are forced to choose. 

> Will it be a declared war or an undeclared war?

It is guerrilla warfare with a growing police state. No opposing forces are going to announce themselves to the public and arrange in neat battle positions.

> The police will protect us.

Historically, cops protect right-wing militias, join right-wing militias, and/or operate as their own ad hoc force in service to whatever charismatic figure promises ""law and order"". Police are people and they will protect their own families before they protect yours.

> My favorite governor/senator/millionaire will protect us.

They will be in their wealthy enclave with their private security forces or in their retreat in New Zealand, or Alaska, or with their money in Panama, Dubai, Monaco, Switzerland, or the Cayman Islands.

> We'll just run away to Canada/Mexico. 

American refugees from climate crises (just within the country) are already predicted to be tens of millions. If things turn kinetic, multiply that by 3. Illegal immigration is not suddenly okay when you try to do it. If your next plan is to hide out in the woods, that's the same plan as a million other people.

> The military will stop it immediately.

First, the military is an apolitical institution. The best scenario is that they don't do anything and remain an institution, ensuring their legitimacy. Second, [soldiers are not apolitical.](http://archive.vn/1CSrN)^9 If a Myanmar scenario occurs, they are likely to fracture when they have to start kicking in doors and bombing population centers that look like their own. That's an increase in militia forces. The upper brass has their own leanings as well. Third, it took about 25,000 soldiers to lock down a square mile of DC for a month after Jan 6. Do the math. The USA is too big for the military to effectively subdue a warring population.

> Civilians aren't armed enough to fight the military!

There are over 400 million guns in this country and a population of about 330 million. And military firearms, actual assault rifles, [go missing all the time.](http://archive.vn/OOZyi)^10 [So do the explosives.](http://archive.vn/7lZdf)^11

> Rednecks with guns can't stop drones!

Drones and tanks exist to perform specific tasks. They are excellent in the conventional format of war between nations. They're not so great against a guerrilla force of maybe 50 million+. A drone can't hold a street corner. Tanks are only as good as their supply chain of fuel. Like we saw in Afghanistan, and what Ethiopia is seeing against Tigray right now; even with all of your fancy weapon systems and national backers, if you are massively outnumbered in asymmetrical warfare then it is just a matter of time. Besides, while a drone pilot may operate out of a secure bunker in Hawaii, they have a family that lives in a city or town like everyone else. It's a dark thing to think about.

Thank you for hearing this, could be nonsense, could be cookie crumbs to the greater picture I've theorized. My theory is this, and I've been thinking about it for quite some time though just haven't fine tuned it - like doing real research into connections 🤣 Dont truly believe this to be the case but idk in the most extreme of cases 🤷‍♂️

A large wealthy group including but certainly not limited to - Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, The Rockefellers, The Kochs, the elites of the CCP, even Elon Musk and his family, Jeffery Epstein, the royal family, the most influential from both sides of politics, the people who own every single ""mainstream"" news station, Anthony Fauci, the churches including scientology, basically all the richest and most influential people in the world are in cahoots and have a plan to inflict the next great reset. Overcoming the next mass extinction by enacting it themselves. Starting with the release of covid and their ""vaccines"". The vaccines over time will cause issues because they aren't actually vaccines but instead alter our DNA and kill everyone who took them over time, slowly, or quickly - yet to be determined. All who are left over will either have all the wealth in the world, or will be those of us who refused to take it due to our distrust in the system, and those in control of it. That will be the last great stand which will inevitably lead to the remainder of us being enslaved, and those who can't be enslaved, will be killed.

I piece this together by the facts that follow: Bill Gates is heavily involved in vaccine research and also buying up as much farm land as possible as well as many other billionaires as an investment. Every news station spitting out the same rhetoric, verbatim. All the while what is actually happening is in general the complete opposite of the news narrative. Covid being used as such a scare tactic when from the beginning it was never all that dangerous to the majority of people. All ""science backed facts"" of which being overturned by the data later on down the road, which is overlooked and downplayed, a narrative always spun by one or more of the above mentioned parties. Vaccines causing more harm than good already, and we're only about a year into their use, just waiting to see what's coming down the pipeline later on. The people being turned against each other because of the fear tactics being spun. This disagreement among even family and friends, forget complete strangers, will tear us apart and prevent us from coming together to face any greater evil at all.

All of that is just the tip of the iceberg imo since I'm just an autistic retard who can't truly piece together all of his thoughts into a coherent storyline. I will probably end up taking time to actually write all of this out and then resubmit I to you folks, so long as reddit isn't completely destroyed by its IPO, or other factors like spam bots. Also, idk if I truly believe this myself, or if it's just my brain taking completely random facts together out of a world that seems to be in flames and trying to gather an explanation for it all. Would love to hear more people add to it, or counter it with logic, but the dismissal of ""conspiracy theories"" and being a nut for coming up with them is what I expect - and would just be further fire into my theory of what will be the next great extinction."

If anything we can all make a damn good fiction novel/movie together. ❤,6,rlzjxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/rlzjxx/my_theory_of_what_is_really_going_on_give_me_your/,22,1640156711.0,"I posted this as a response to someone but I figured it would be a good post here, and this community I feel I can relay this to, if no one else.. Thank you for hearing this, could be nonsense, could be cookie crumbs to the greater picture I've theorized. My theory is this, and I've been thinking about it for quite some time though just haven't fine tuned it - like doing real research into connections 🤣 Dont truly believe this to be the case but idk in the most extreme of cases 🤷‍♂️

A large wealthy group including but certainly not limited to - Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, The Rockefellers, The Kochs, the elites of the CCP, even Elon Musk and his family, Jeffery Epstein, the royal family, the most influential from both sides of politics, the people who own every single ""mainstream"" news station, Anthony Fauci, the churches including scientology, basically all the richest and most influential people in the world are in cahoots and have a plan to inflict the next great reset. Overcoming the next mass extinction by enacting it themselves. Starting with the release of covid and their ""vaccines"". The vaccines over time will cause issues because they aren't actually vaccines but instead alter our DNA and kill everyone who took them over time, slowly, or quickly - yet to be determined. All who are left over will either have all the wealth in the world, or will be those of us who refused to take it due to our distrust in the system, and those in control of it. That will be the last great stand which will inevitably lead to the remainder of us being enslaved, and those who can't be enslaved, will be killed.

I piece this together by the facts that follow: Bill Gates is heavily involved in vaccine research and also buying up as much farm land as possible as well as many other billionaires as an investment. Every news station spitting out the same rhetoric, verbatim. All the while what is actually happening is in general the complete opposite of the news narrative. Covid being used as such a scare tactic when from the beginning it was never all that dangerous to the majority of people. All ""science backed facts"" of which being overturned by the data later on down the road, which is overlooked and downplayed, a narrative always spun by one or more of the above mentioned parties. Vaccines causing more harm than good already, and we're only about a year into their use, just waiting to see what's coming down the pipeline later on. The people being turned against each other because of the fear tactics being spun. This disagreement among even family and friends, forget complete strangers, will tear us apart and prevent us from coming together to face any greater evil at all.

All of that is just the tip of the iceberg imo since I'm just an autistic retard who can't truly piece together all of his thoughts into a coherent storyline. I will probably end up taking time to actually write all of this out and then resubmit I to you folks, so long as reddit isn't completely destroyed by its IPO, or other factors like spam bots. Also, idk if I truly believe this myself, or if it's just my brain taking completely random facts together out of a world that seems to be in flames and trying to gather an explanation for it all. Would love to hear more people add to it, or counter it with logic, but the dismissal of ""conspiracy theories"" and being a nut for coming up with them is what I expect - and would just be further fire into my theory of what will be the next great extinction."
70,0,Reddit monetization after IPO,114,rkfjmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rkfjmx/reddit_monetization_after_ipo/,77,1639977765.0,"Hi all,

Something I've been thinking about lately is Reddit going Public. 

A big reason companies IPO is to cash out or sellout to become billionaires*.  Usually the company grows and becomes worth a lot more, however the platform changes dramatically.  The once private company, then focuses on the balance sheet and pinches pennies and pushes revenue boosting tactics.  

Take Facebook or YouTube as an example.  Facebook was a decent social networking platform before they became public.  Also, didn't use predatorial tactics to keep our attention before.  I remember when I could watch videos on YouTube for hours... Now google wants to show us videos they want us to watch.  

I've watched Reddit also change the past couple years. 

I'm disappointed like your dads disappointment.  

Reddit is going to change, and it's not going to be the better.   They are Sellouts.  You will see ads on top of ads and features be restricted/ removed. 

An alternative of Reddit will surface, I will be waiting...."

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 17, 2021**

Stocks extended Thursday’s losses, with the market ending a volatile week in the red as market participants continued to digest ongoing risk surrounding the Omicron variant and the Fed’s new monetary policy, which signaled a faster rate of taper and interest rate hikes next year. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.02%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.50%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.42%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.92% 
* Volatility Index: +3.19%
* JP Morgan (JPM): -2.28%
* Oracle (ORCL): -6.39%
* AMC: +19.22%
* FedEx (FDX): 4.95%
* Rivian (RIVN): -10.26%

The main focus of market participants remains on the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision, with the Central Bank doubling the pace of tapering and suggestions that the interest rate may be raised three times in 2022.

The potential for higher rates continues to weigh heavily on technology and growth stocks whose valuations rely heavily on future earnings potential. In the last month, the Nasdaq has fallen by -3.43% and the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 8.32% in the last month.

On the other hand, cyclical stocks in the energy and financials sectors outperformed on Thursday, with the prospects of higher interest rates and stronger growth seen as benefiting these sectors. The Dow Jones (DIA) has only lost -1.23% in the month and has been trending upwards in December. As always, it’s important to balance a portfolio with both growth and value stocks.

Troy Gayeski, Chief Market Strategist at F5 Investments, said “The thing investors have to understand is, we're going through a major transition in monetary policy. The Fed has been running emergency policies arguably far longer than they should have been, and as that money supply growth slows down as they ease off the balance sheet expansion and ultimately hike next year, one would at least expect more volatility in markets. And that's really what we've been seeing the last month."" 

**Highlights** 

* The Biden administration on Friday recommended the Federal Communications Commission grant Alphabet's Google and Facebook-parent Meta licenses for an undersea cable.
* The companies entered into national security agreements to protect data on the Pacific Light Cable Network system, an undersea fiber optic cable system that will connect the United States, Taiwan and the Philippines.
* Tesla Inc was hit by a lawsuit over CEO Elon Musk's social media posts including his Twitter poll on stock sales that pulled down its stock prices. Investor David Wagner called for access to internal documents to investigate whether Tesla and Musk failed to adhere to fiduciary duties
* Rivian stock gapped down another roughly 11%  after the company reported earnings that showed steep losses and said it expects to fall “a few hundred vehicles short of its 1,200 production target for this year.
* Alibaba Deputy CFO Toby Xu, making his first major public remarks since being named this month to take over as CFO, said that international e-commerce ""will become one of the key growth drivers"", adding that 57% of revenue for Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics unit, comes from overseas.
* Reddit announced it was filing for an IPO with an estimated $15 billion valuation. I love the platform but I think they’ll have a hard time monetizing users.
* Rivian also announced it was planning to build a new factory in Georgia in order to boost production
* Kellogg’s has reached a new tentative agreement with its 1,400 striking cereal plant workers that could bring an end to the strike that began Oct. 5."
72,2,Negativity around Reddit's IPO is loaded with bias.,31,rho3z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rho3z0/negativity_around_reddits_ipo_is_loaded_with_bias/,134,1639651006.0,"It's very similar bias to what a Chicago native will speak on Portillos being a public company - they feel so at home with the product that they feel comfortable critiquing it, despite being a regular customer.

I study Metaverse and social media investments and am greatly looking forward to Reddit's IPO.


In my view, the future of Reddit is going to be deeper focus in it's subreddit communities. The CEO is on record saying it looks up to Roblox's community model of game creators (subreddit owners) and players (posts/comments)


In my view, Reddit going public isn't going to be some advertising nightmare for consumers. That part happened years ago when Reddit focused on mobile. Reddit is going to focus on content creation and getting subreddits more active with incentives.

For example, Roblox has engagement based payouts for games, where the creator is paid based on time spent in a game. How much of your time on Reddit is spent on a few subreddits?

I'm also fascinated with how much redditors are willing to spend on digital goods on this app. I think we will soon see a Reddit marketplace that we aren't really expecting too.



I'm really excited for this and Im going all in along with Block for 2022."

# [Dow futures up 200 points following Fed decision to aggressively wind down asset purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/stock-futures-market-open-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose sharply in early Thursday trading after the Federal Reserve signaled it would be aggressive on tapering and sees three interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped about 222 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.7% each.
*****
> Shares of companies that have done well in previous rate-hiking cycles led premarket gainers. Materials stocks FMC Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan both rose more than 3% ahead of the opening bell. Bank stocks also rose across the board, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America all up about 0.6%.
*****
> In transportation news, Delta Air Lines reported that it now expects to see a profit of $200 million in the fourth quarter, after previously projecting a loss. Shares rose 2.2% on the news.
*****
> In other central banking news, the Bank of England announced it is hiking its key policy rate by 15 basis points to 0.25%. Markets were awaiting a separate policy decision from the European Central Bank. There also is more economic news on tap, with weekly jobless claims and housing starts out at 8:30 a.m. ET.
*****
> Following the Fed news, traders accelerated their own expectations for interest rate increases. Fed funds futures trading now points to a 63% chance of the first quarter-percentage-point increase coming in May 2022, with chances also rising to about 44% that the central bank could make its first move as soon as March, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
*****
> Stocks traded in negative territory throughout the regular session Wednesday and turned higher ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference in the afternoon at the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Dow added 383 points, or 1.08%. The S&P 500 rose 1.63% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.15%.
*****
> “The fact that the FOMC acknowledged new COVID variants as a threat to the economic recovery that could alter policy going forward, as well as the generally optimistic tone from Powell in the presser, helped spark a relief rally as the Fed meeting was viewed as being not-as-hawkish-as-feared,” Tom Essaye of the Sevens Report said in a note on Thursday.
*****
> The Fed will begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases in January and buy just $60 billion of bonds each month going forward, compared to $90 billion in the month of December. That decision follows recent inflation data showing a 6.8% surge in November, which is higher than expected and the fastest rate since 1982.
*****
> “The notion that elevated inflation levels would be transitory has finally been thrown out the window by the Fed and the latest policy adjustments are reflective of a committee that doesn’t want to miss the next train leaving the station,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
*****
> Health-care stocks UnitedHealth and Amgen gained ground Wednesday, rising 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively.
*****
> Adobe and Accenture are scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the opening bell. FedEx and Rivian will report after the bell.

74,4,Reddit Files Confidentially for IPO Social media company says in blog post it filed paperwork with SEC to go public.,12,rhli2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rhli2j/reddit_files_confidentially_for_ipo_social_media/,24,1639639616.0,"Most recently, the company announced that it had raised a $700 million round in August 2021 at a valuation of more than $10 billion. The social media company did not make the filing publicly available. The company also did not say how many shares would be offered nor the price range for the proposed offering.

Although Reddit was created in 2005, it has taken a unique road toward going public.

Conde Nast Publications acquired Reddit in 2006. The social media services remained a part of the publication company until it was made an independent subsidiary in 2011. Since then, it raised a series of funding rounds from venture capital firms. 

Reddit Inc. is considering ways to make its share offering more accessible to individual investors as it plans to go public, Chief Executive Steve Huffman said.

Mr. Huffman the market is evolving in a way that makes it easier for even small investors to buy into new offerings, he said at The Wall Street Journal’s Tech Live conference Monday. It is often difficult for individual investors to buy into hot initial public offerings. “I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our shareholders to be users,” Mr. Huffman said at the conference, which the Journal hosted virtually with top executives."

# [S&P 500 looks set to add to its record close from Friday with futures higher](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> S&P 500 futures rose early Monday after the index notched its best week since February at a fresh record close, rebounding from a big sell-off triggered by fears of the omicron coronavirus variant.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded 40 points higher, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures inched up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.34%.
*****
> Moderna shares were among the strongest gainers premarket Monday, rising 2.4% a day after the White House’s top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci called Covid booster shots “optimal care,” but said the definition of fully vaccinated would not change.
*****
> Elsewhere, Apple moved closer in its quest to become the market’s first $3 trillion company, gaining 1% premarket following an upgrade from JP Morgan.
*****
> Also, chipmaker Nvidia, which has become a signature reopening trade, was up 1.7% on optimism that omicron would not be as disruptive as initially thought.
*****
> The early Monday action followed a strong week on Wall Street as investors shrugged off a hot inflation reading. The blue-chip Dow gained 4% last week, breaking a four-week losing streak with its best weekly performance since March. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively, last week, both posting their best weekly performance since early February.
*****
> Investors digested a jump in headline inflation data, which came in at 6.8% in November year-over-year for the biggest surge since 1982. The print was marginally higher than the 6.7% Dow Jones estimate.
*****
> “The fact is that inflation is likely to remain on the higher side for a while and risks of sticky inflation remain, although we believe that the passing of base effects and the easing of supply chain constraints by the end of the first quarter of next year should slowly bring inflation down to more comfortable levels,” Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in a note.
*****
> The key inflation reading came ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting this week where the policymakers are expected to discuss speeding up the end of its bond-buying program.
*****
> Fed Chair Jerome Powell, as well as a parade of Fed speakers, all recently suggested the central bank could end the $120 billion monthly bond purchase program sooner than the current timeline of June 2022.
*****
> “We believe markets can continue take a higher inflation reading in their stride, though additional volatility remains a risk. With Fed policy staying relatively accommodative, the backdrop for equities is still positive, and we favor winners from global growth,” said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer of UBS Global Wealth Management.
*****
> Stocks bounced back last week as investors bet that the initial worry about the Covid strain is overblown. Many also took solace in the news from Pfizer and BioNTech that a study found three doses of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the variant.
*****
> As of Sunday, the U.S. was approaching 800,000 coronavirus-related deaths. The new variant has pushed some government officials to reinstate health restrictions to slow the spread.

# [Dow futures nudge higher after Wednesday’s Fed-induced sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Dow futures edged higher in early trading Thursday, recovering after worries over tighter monetary policy led to the first losing regular trading session of the year.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 104 points, or 0.29%. S&P 500 futures were little changed and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.37%.
*****
> Energy shares helped boost the market in early action as crude prices rose 1.5%. Marathon Oil gained 2.6%, Occidental Petroleum was up 2.2% and ExxonMobil rose 1.3%.
*****
> Rate-sensitive stocks also were higher a day after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting revealed the central bank is getting ready to remove its economic help more more quickly than anticipated. Officials discussed reducing the Fed’s balance sheet in another move to dial back its pandemic-era easy monetary policy.
*****
> Bank of America saw its shares increase 1.5% premarket and Citigroup rose 1.4% and Wells Fargo gained 1.3%.
*****
> The Fed’s plan to reduce the number of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities it holds comes as it is already tapering its bond purchases and is set to hike interest rates after the taper concludes.
*****
> “Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate,” the minutes stated.
*****
> Stocks slid following the release of the minutes. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 392.54 points, or 1.07%, lower after hitting an intraday record earlier in the session. The S&P 500 fell 1.94%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw its biggest one-day loss since February, losing 3.34%.
*****
> The Fed update also pushed the 10-year yield to above 1.75%. It ended last year at 1.51%.
*****
> “If you ride a wave of liquidity to the upside and that liquidity starts to go away, I don’t think it’s terribly surprising that you’re going to see a reaction,” said Kathy Jones, head of fixed income at Charles Schwab.
*****
> “This was the year we were going to transition from extremely easy monetary policy and fiscal policy to less easy monetary and less expansive fiscal policy. That has to have some impact on risk assets that have risen because the discount rate was so low,” Jones added.
*****
> All 11 S&P 500 sectors fell in Wednesday’s session.
*****
> Elsewhere Thursday, shares of Allbirds rallied more than 4% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the shoe brand, whose stock has struggled since it went public in November.
*****
> Investors await quarterly earnings reports from Walgreens Boots Alliance and Bed Bath & Beyond before the bell Thursday.
*****
> On the data front, the weekly jobless claims report is slated for released Thursday morning. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect that claims totaled 195,000 for the week ended Jan. 1. Trade balance data is also due, with economists looking for the deficit in goods and services to total $81.5 billion.
*****
> The releases come a day ahead of the Labor Department’s key nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show that the economy added 422,000 jobs in December. However, payroll processing firm ADP reported Wednesday that companies added a much higher-than-expected 807,000 positions for the month, indicating a possible upside surprise to Friday’s count from the department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.

# [Stock futures slip lower ahead of key inflation data, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures were marginally lower during morning trading Tuesday after the major averages started the week in the red as Covid omicron fears hit sentiment.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 futures declined 0.13% while and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by nearly 0.5%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced between gains and losses.
*****
> Tesla shares were among the biggest early droppers on the S&P 500, falling 2.3% premarket after CEO Elon Musk announced that that he has sold another $906.5 million in shares.
*****
> Fellow automaker Ford also fell, down 2.2% following news that by 2030 Toyota would be investing $35 billion into battery-powered electronic vehicles, a space where Ford has sought to establish itself as a leader. Toyota itself declined even more, with shares off 3.4% premarket.
*****
> Pfizer shares rose nearly 1% after final results of tests on its Covid drug showed it reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 89% in high-risk patients.
*****
> The market will get fresh inflation data Tuesday when November’s producer price index number is reported. Economists are expecting it to show that prices rose 0.5% for the month, according to estimates from Dow Jones. This would be a slight slowdown from October’s 0.6% increase.
*****
> The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.
*****
> Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday that he thinks the central bank should start raising rates soon.
*****
> “The Federal Reserve would be better off storing away some of rate increases, so when the inevitable turn down comes, you’ve got some ammunition to fight with,” he said. “At the moment, at zero interest rates, we have no ammunition.”
*****
> Investors will be watching closely for commentary around if the Fed plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank’s asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.
*****
> “So far the bond market has given the Fed a pass on inflation — whether it will continue to do so is in doubt,” noted Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. “The real fireworks coming from the meeting are likely to be around expectations for rate hikes in 2022,” he added.
*****
> The latest CNBC Fed Survey showed that investment professionals and economists expect the Fed to wind down its asset purchases by March and begin rate hikes in June.
*****
> During trading Monday, the Dow slid 0.89%, or 320 points, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.39% as investors rotated out of technology stocks with high valuations.
*****
> Shares of airlines and cruise line operators declined amid fears that the omicron variant could slow travel.
*****
> While equities fell broadly on Monday, growth areas of the market underperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF dipped 1.22%, while the iShares Russell 1,000 Value ETF declined 0.45%.
*****
> Despite Monday’s decline for equities, the S&P 500 is roughly 1.6% below its Nov. 22 all-time intraday high. The Dow is 2.5% below its record, while the Nasdaq Composite is about 5% under its high-water mark. The Russell 2000 index is down a sharper 11.3% since its Nov. 8 high.
*****
> Looking forward, some strategists, including LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick, believe there’s upside ahead for equities.
*****
> “We believe pent-up demand, gradual improvement in supply chain challenges, solid labor force growth, and productivity gains will all contribute to another year of above-trend economic growth in 2022,” he wrote in a note to clients. “COVID-19-related risks remain and the potential for a policy mistake may be elevated as the economy moves towards normalization, but we think the overall environment will be supportive of business growth and ultimately equity markets,” he added.

# [Stock futures little changed after the Dow notches a record close](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mixed in early morning trading Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a record close the previous day as investors flocked to shares that stand to benefit from an economic recovery.
*****
> Futures on the blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 were flat, while Nasdaq 100 futures moved 0.3% lower.
*****
> Early losers included Dow component Salesforce, which fell more than 2% in premarket trading following a downgrade from UBS, which also cut Adobe, sending its shares down 1.8%.
*****
> Markets also faced pressure from stocks associated with the economic reopening: Wynn Resorts fell 2%, while Las Vegas Sands was off 1.5%. With Covid cases rising, pharma companies were under pressure, with Regeneron down 3% following a downgrade from Bank of America.
*****
> The moves come as investors look for clues on where the economy stood heading into the new year.
*****
> ADP will be out with its monthly private payrolls count at 8:15 a.m., with the Dow Jones estimate at 375,000 for December. That report will come ahead of Friday’s more closely watched nonfarm payrolls count, which is expected to show a gain of 422,000.
*****
> Investors also awaited the release of minutes from the December Federal Reserve meeting. Policymakers decided then to accelerate the pace of the monthly bond buying taper and indicated that three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes are coming in 2022. They also adjusted their outlook on inflation and economic growth.
*****
> However, the market will be looking for additional information on where officials see policy heading, particularly on what will happen with the Fed’s nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
> On Tuesday, while the Dow climbed 200 points to a new high, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite suffered a sell-off, down 1.3%, amid a rapid rise in Treasury yields. The closely-watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was as high as 1.71% Tuesday, triggering selling in growth-oriented technology stocks.
*****
> Megacap tech stocks underperformed the S&P 500 Tuesday as “investors reconsidered the value of such long-duration assets in the wake of higher rates,” Chris Hussey, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said in a note.
*****
> “The Fed is accelerating its removal of liquidity because inflation has broadened, which has the potential to push 10-year yields higher,” Ed Al-Hussainy, senior rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle, said in a note. “But the central bank must be careful not to act too aggressively, which could derail the economic recovery and cause a recession.”
*****
> Wall Street strategists are expecting a bumpier road ahead for the stock market as the Fed begins to tighten its ultra-easy monetary policy. The median year-end target for the S&P 500 now stands at 5,050, only a 5% gain from Tuesday’s close of 4,793.54, according to CNBC’s Strategist Survey.

# [Stock futures turn higher after the S&P 500 hits another record](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/27/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
> U.S. stocks were poised to build on record highs in the final week of the year as futures rose Tuesday morning.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added about 90 points, while those for the S&P 500 gained 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 were up 0.5%.
*****
> The move in futures comes after stocks rallied in Monday’s regular session, with the S&P 500 rising roughly 1.4% to close at a record high. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4%, while the Dow climbed about 352 points.
*****
> Markets continued to look to pandemic news for direction.
*****
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Monday that it was shortening its isolation recommendation for people who test positive to five days from 10, if those people do not have symptoms.
*****
> Research out of South Africa also indicated that omicron infections can help boost immunity to the earlier delta strain of Covid.
*****
> Pharmaceutical stocks dipped in early trading following the relatively optimistic news on the pandemic. Moderna slipped 1.6% and Pfizer was marginally lower in light premarket trading Tuesday morning.
*****
> Stocks dipped in late November, in part because of the rise of the omicron variant of Covid-19, but have since rebounded as governments have largely shied away from reinstating lockdowns and strict social distancing measures.
*****
> Airline stocks did struggle on Monday, however, as the spread of the virus led to hundreds of flight cancelations around the Christmas holiday. Apple also announced that it was closing its New York City stores to customers due to the spike in Covid cases.
*****
> Stocks tend to rise in light trading during the final days of the year, often called the “Santa Claus rally.” However, many Wall Street pros predict relatively small gains for stocks in 2022 after two strong years.
*****
> “If you look around Wall Street, you see very tame expectations, and it’s probably a reflection that we’re probably pretty late in the cycle,” Jim Lacamp, senior vice president at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said on “Closing Bell.”
*****
> In addition to the S&P 500′s record close, the Dow is within 1% of its intraday all-time high, while the Nasdaq is about 2% below its high-water mark.
*****
> For the year, the S&P 500 is up 27.6% for the year and the Nasdaq is up 23.1%. The Dow is the laggard, up 18.6%.
*****
> It is a slow week overall for economic data, but investors will get a look at home prices on Tuesday when the October reading for the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index is released before the bell.

# [Stock futures are little changed ahead of key Fed decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-key-fed-decision-.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were little changed in early morning trading on Wednesday as investors readied for Wednesday’s highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision.
*****
> Dow futures gained 8 points. S&P 500 futures were flat, and the Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%.
*****
> The Fed will conclude its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and the public will hear from central bank Chairman Jerome Powell at a 2:30 p.m. ET news conference.
*****
> The Fed is grappling with the highest inflation level in 39 years and the central bank is widely expected to announce an acceleration of the tapering of its bond-buying program, which was put in place during the pandemic to prop up the economy.
*****
> “Investors remain on a buyers strike in front of the FOMC meeting,” Fundstrat’s Tom Lee wrote in a note. “Tapering is not the ‘hawkish pivot’ that ends bull markets, but it is a hawkish pivot relative to the massive easing since the pandemic started. So we think this buyers strike in front of FOMC could turn into a ‘buy the event.’”
*****
> This sets the stage for a dramatic policy shift that will clear the way for a first interest rate hike next year.
*****
> A CNBC Fed Survey predicts the Fed will double the pace of the taper to $30 billion at its December meeting, which would end the $120 billion in monthly asset purchases by about March. The central bank will then hike rates three times in each of the next two years, starting in June 2022, the survey respondents predict.
*****
> “While the chairman is not likely to suggest any specific timeframe for when the funds rate will begin to be lifted, he probably will confirm that some members do want to move more quickly than previously announced in raising interest rates,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.
*****
> “I would not expect the Fed to say much that is not already anticipated by the financial markets,” Paulsen added. “Some of the recent stock market volatility may lessen after this two-day meeting and its press conference is finally concluded.”
*****
> On the political front, congressional Democrats passed a bill raising the debt ceiling, sending it to President Joe Biden early Wednesday just under the wire for when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government would run out of spending power.
*****
> On Tuesday, the major averages slipped, exacerbated by selling in software names like Microsoft and Adobe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 106 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.75%.
*****
> The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.1% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.
*****
> Also hurting sentiment Tuesday was the hotter-than-expected inflation reading for November’s producer price index showing a year-over-year increase of 9.6%, the fastest pace on record. This was above the 9.2% expected by economists, according to Dow Jones. The index rose 0.8% month over month, above the 0.5% expected.
*****
> While the Fed meeting is in focus, investors are also monitoring the new Covid variant omicron. The World Health Organization on Tuesday warned the new Covid-19 omicron variant is spreading faster than any previous strain, and is likely in most countries of the world.
*****
> November’s retail sales data is slated to release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting that retail sales rose 0.8% in November, compared to October’s growth of 1.7%, according to the Commerce Department.

82,0,Reddit to go public with a valuation over $15 billion?,9,rinwjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/IPO/comments/rinwjj/reddit_to_go_public_with_a_valuation_over_15/,5,1639766460.0,Reddit has filed confidential paperwork with the securities and exchange commission to IPO and go public. Sources have told Reuters that the company is aiming for a valuation above $15 billion which will be interesting to see if/when reddit goes public.  Reddit’s valuation doubled to $6 in February as a result of wallstreetbets and the gamestop and amc short squeezes. In August the company was valued at $10 billion in a private fundraising round.  Opinions on the IPO tend to believe that the company will join other tech companies in trading at a premium due to rapidly growing revenues. Given wallstreetbets crazy antics I will be interested to see what will happen on the day of a prospective IPO.

[Reddit's majority shareholder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit) is [Advance Publications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications). That company is owned by the Newhouse family, which is headed up by Donald Newhouse (pictured), who is worth $15.5 to 18.5 billion today, depending on whether you believe [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/profile/donald-newhouse/?sh=67d462bd1581) or [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/donald-e-newhouse/). Some of the early investors are listed in the Wikipedia article, and the later ones are listed on [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/reddit/company_financials).

The value of Reddit has skyrocketed during the last year. Revenue in Q2 was over [$100 million, a jump of 192%](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-secures-funding-to-continue-growth-plans/) from the year before. With their last round of funding, the company is now valued at at least $10 billion. At the beginning of the year, it was [valued at $6 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/reddits-valuation-doubles-to-6-billion-after-new-250-million-funding-round-.html).

Of course, Reddit's revenue and value come from advertising and selling user data. When the app is free, that means that you are the product. They need eyeballs on the app, and those eyeballs come almost entirely from content (like this post) and comments provided for free by unpaid users. The vast majority of the moderation work is also unpaid.

I think one could make an argument that getting out the message of r/antiwork is worth the trade, though some might disagree.  However, it seems to me that if you believe in the spirit of this subreddit, you should think about whether you want to post on subreddits that do not advance the agenda, like cooking, sports, and r/IdiotsInCars.

A site so popular with so many users that it literally sold for a billion when a billion ACTUALLY was worth something

2013  Yahoo bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion

2019 Wordpress buys Tumblr for $3 million

Why?

Tumblr went down the path of banning explicit content, smut, bascially everything that was driving user growth. NSFW for everything bad, is a huge catalyst for users, activity and every single metric that matters.

Look at the fear that happened when Onlyfans decided they aren't a porn/sexworker place and wanted to go in another direction? Massive backlash and now they may not be able to go public.

Reddit has a huge base of NSFW activity, subreddits that discuss things that wouldn't fly anywhere else. While the CEO has said previously they aren't willing to ban porn and other objectionable content. That was before reddit goes public and suddenly becomes worth suing.

Imagine someone posts some revenge porn, or copy righted material, or someone follows DD and loses all their life savings investing in Silver derivatives. Sure reddit can say they police but that argument isn't helping instagram, facebook, pornhub. 

Reddit was too small to sue before. If reddit goes public I guarantee they will be worth suing there's going to be a ton of crack downs.

I’ve been thinking a lot about the Reddit IPO - a few years ago I heard Shaq say that he doesn’t invest in companies he believes in, he invests in companies he USES…and that philosophy has worked out really well for him (especially his big Google purchase). 

With that shared, I’m thinking of making a big investment in Reddit. I think Reddit has the ability to go ALL the way. 

However, as a MEMBER and serious considering INVESTOR - here are my concerns (also happy to hear everyone else’s thoughts and concerns on this topic):

- When Reddit becomes an IPO is it subject to more oversight? One of the things that I love about Reddit is it’s open market style - from Wall Street Bets convos, to OnlyFans & prostitution channels, info on replica gear, and honest on anything we can imagine. Will that be lost? How might censorship play a role in Reddit becoming an IPO? Could that lead to the death of Reddit from a user perspective? Might users be required to reveal more of their private information? Will our data and conversations be sold or used against us? 

These are big picture concerns for me. If Reddit is able to survive as it does in this current moment, I think it has the opportunity to be HUGE and worth a Wall Streets Bets rally. 

What’s everyone else’s thoughts on this?"

While I also think that Reddit is not a ""goldmine"" in an of itself this is not where the value comes from. Institutions typically buy news and media stocks like crazy. Institutional ownership of the New York times (NYT) for instance is currently above 93% which is ""typical"" for news companies.

[institutional ownership of the new York times https:\/\/money.cnn.com\/quote\/shareholders\/shareholders.html?symb=NYT&subView=institutional](https://preview.redd.it/jr1zuhbhcia81.jpg?width=634&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a1e43115369e64f51ca9671ddfd25497763572f)

Is this because the NYT or news companies in general are so profitable? Well, while the NYT made a profit of 65.1 million in the third quarter 2021, an increase of 15% from the same quarter one year ago, I do not think that this is the actual reason. Rather the true value comes from elsewhere. If you own it you can decide which articles are published, which topics are covered and have influence on the narrative. I.e. owning these companies allows you to push out news that positively affect stocks you are long on and negatively affect stocks you shorted. This is were their actual value for institutions comes from.

Or do you think stuff like this happens on coincidence?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6U2Un5kEdI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6U2Un5kEdI&t=14s)

Anyways, I think the same is true for Reddit. They already do this to some extent but owning the actual company will help to ""tighten"" their grip. There is a new fancy stock you want to pump and dump? Just push out some discussion on it on Reddit. You are short a stock and do not want people to FOMO in? selectively shadow ban mentions of this stock, change rules to keep rumors about it from spreading etc.

104,6,Reddit IPO Valuation,51,rkra3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rkra3v/reddit_ipo_valuation/,48,1640018158.0,"As you all know, Reddit has begun its process to file for an IPO. As we all use the platform and are most likely going to trade it, one way or the other, I see it prudent to open source this back of the napkin valuation to see what you autists think. 

**The Metrics**

Reddit, like all of the other social media platforms, primarily generates its revenue from ads. Thus, the KPIs we want to look at here are the MAUs and the average visit duration. Since, theoretically, the money from advertisers is going to flow to the company that has the most people coming to the platform and staying for the most amount of time. 

\*\*Since Snapchat doesn't give the MAU data, only the DAU, I just took the DAU and multiplied it by 2 lol. 

\*\*For any data that was missing, I normalized it by utilizing the respective company's MAU CAGR. 

MAU CAGR:

[I thought only moms used Pinterest](https://preview.redd.it/ba1o597f2q681.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=124bc03ae65ef95207544d62029d7ff7b0756a90)

MAU:

[Normalized by not including Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/szr9xkhsrp681.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=4258944ef27b8736c9c3db14798c2844c2150074)

Average Visit Duration:

[SNAP is assumed at 30 minutes](https://preview.redd.it/g7571g5wsp681.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9727504d3c00a71b60c0f12ee9ec880f84db9706)

Now, if we look at the 2026 MAUs, by using their MAU CAGR, and multiple the current average visit duration of each platform, we get the 2026 monthly average viewership. This metric is what ad sellers would most likely want to see.

2026 Monthly Average Viewership:

[In Minutes](https://preview.redd.it/ogxwigrovp681.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f4e0516518d532445067faec4ca43d4c9b62d38)

Here, we see Facebook as the clear platform winner, however, Reddit has continued to grow and has usurped Snapchat and Pinterest to become the #2 platform in monthly viewership. 

Now, with this \*information\* taken into consideration, the market is currently pricing these platforms at the following valuations:

**FB**: 903B

**TWTR**: 34B

**SNAP**: 72B

**PINS**: 23B

And I assign a value multiple comparing each platform's 2026 av. monthly viewership to Reddit's and then use that multiple to find the comparative market cap of Reddit. 

**FB**: -2.09 => 432B

**TWTR**: 1.86 => 63B

**SNAP**: 1.07 => 76B

**PINS**: 1.52 => 35B

Now, we have a range of Reddit comp valuations that I take the median of and slap a 40% safety of margin to because I know I am wrong. This returns a market valuation for Reddit of 50B. If we exclude Facebook from the list, we get a median return of 45B. For some reason, though, I think this is far too much and the likely range of valuation would be closer to 30B-45B.

All in all, Reddit is currently priced at $10B via its last series funding round. As we close in on the IPO date I suspect Reddit will begin to rapidly gain in valuation. Maybe we'll see it trade up to or even more than 45B. Who knows? I certainly do not have a clue. But as more info comes out I would like to see how off this valuation is. 

This sub has really shit on Reddit's IPO because you all think it'll follow with heavy censorship and/or monetization. If Reddit fucks with anything in that way it essentially destroys its platform. -that's all I'll say on that."

\* Reddit's market cap of $15 B is based off news reports and it could be higher or lower.

\*\* Meta is a combination of Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp

What is everyone thinking about this IPO. Clearly, monetization is an issue but you are also getting a steep discount per user so if they manage to increase monetization this might have some nice growth in it."

We all know what happened after once mighty Tumblr banned adult content - their user base evaporated by almost 50% practically overnight and they are no longer a household name. Even bringing back limited amounts of adult content didn’t help them. 

If Reddit pulls the same stunt, how long so you think that it will take their stock to tumble and what way would be the best way to capitalize on it?

Reddit was invented by young libertarian types but has slowly acquiesced to demands of the government and special interest groups. There is a long line of failed social media sires before Reddit came on the scene and Reddit’s technology could be easily replicated. 

I only see corporate board types and shareholders destroying the formula that makes Reddit special.

Note that these are on testnet and there should be 0 value for testnet tokens, on mainnet everything will change and we might see serious increase in valuation.

Reddit is actually working on what seems to be a DAO, Decentralised Autonomous Organisation

Reddit are decentralising their own platform by introducing Reddit Community Points to certain subreddits, this is done by tokenizing Karma - each month users gets tokens equivalent to their Karma (Posts and Comments in the subreddit), this number gets reduced by 2.5% each month until all tokens are minted 2035 approximately.

This experiment launched (Beta / Testnet) on May 2020 with rCryptocurrency and rFortnite subreddits being involved (Moons and Bricks).As a community we have been the Beta testers of this for quite some time now. Some of us have made some beautiful unrealised gains with Moons and farming with shitposts. At the moment there are 200k+ unique holders for these Community Points.

Arguably moons have changed the community a lot, whether its for the best or not is up to each individual. I have enjoyed this experiment and have also made some nice profits

**What is the usage of these points?**

1. Voting Power in Governance Polls that changes the subreddit rules.
2. Tipping between users on Reddit.
3. Buying premium Membership on Reddit.
4. Converting Points to Reddit Tokens.
5. Buying Budgets and items on Reddit.

**What is unique about this?**

True ownership, once you receive the tokens, no one can take them from you or manipulate them, even Reddit themselves. Just like with our moons

Reddit Community Points can be traded like any other tokens! Imagine WSB getting unique tokens for its holders - Like Joseph Lubin said “If you think GME story is wild, wait until Reddit Tokens launch on Mainnet “.

Just think about it. It had the price $0.4 in August. Without a mainnet, without a use case, without an entity behind them that's going to IPO soon (if you [missed the news](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/reddit-ipo/)). All of those are in the pipeline, and really soon. The price was $0.4, 40% of ""dream price"", with being available only on two smallish swap sites. With daily volume of a few thousand of $. Without anyone (besides people here) knowing about them.

Doge has the marketcap of $25 billion. No one in their right mind would think this is possible just a year ago. It's a joke, for Satoshi's sake. It did not have a whitepaper a week ago. It just started, and against all odds started going up, giving tremendous return to the holders that thought of it as a joke.

Sure, Doge was one of the first meme coins and practically no one can top their meme coin status. Except Shib did just a few weeks/months ago. Of all the meme coins, Shib did it (this makes no sense, but that's a different topic).

So, Moons have a max supply of 250 mill (I'm, for the sake of being on the conservative side, not including the burned tokens and project for the full 250mil, even though not all of them are on the blockchain yet). For them to reach that kind of mcap ($25B), they'd need to have a price of around $100. That's right, over 800x from where it is now.

Insert Keannu ""Woah"" gif, I know. Hear me out, though.

Now, who's to say Moons cannot do that? Even the almighty ETH had a smaller mcap than that during 2018. Which is exactly my point. The total crypto mcap is $2.5 trillion, and topped around $3 trillion this year. When it's growing, it's insane. There is not a single reason why moons cannot do that (that Doge and Shib have not overcome).

If/when Moons get on the mainnet, and if/when they develop a solid use case for them, I don't see a single reason why it could not be at that mcap. Doge and Shib did it without a use case. And without a legal entity behind them, preparing for an IPO. But it's most likely gonna be (sorry for the downer) the next bull run, not this one."

These shares are usually common stock which gives investors a right to vote and earn dividends (if dividends are offered). The right to vote is the important part. If an individual or group can buy a majority \[ 50% plus 1\] of a company's voting stock, known as a controlling equity interest, then that individual or group has significant influence in the operating decisions of the company. However, a majority is not always required and significant influence can be achieved through owning a plurality of voting shares.

This is where a DAO comes in. I think we all remember the ConstitutionDAO that valiantly tried to buy one of the 13 copies of the U.S Constitution. In what was our crypto National Treasure moment, we were presented with a real-world example of the power of crypto technology. Thousands of individuals, ""The People"", participated to fundraise money and buy a piece of history. A RedditDAO could attempt a similar feat, but instead of buying an artifact, we could buy a controlling share of Reddit. We could all have a voice on the board of a publically traded company. We would be able to influence strategic and operational changes that impact Reddit users (all of us). Instead of being at the whims of management, we could become a part of management.

I neither know the legal behind a DAO having a seat on the board of a publically traded company nor do I know the steps toward creating a DAO, but If someone with the know-how and resources does then this could be an interesting endeavor.

For those of you that didn't labor through the paragraphs above here is the TLDR:

TLDR: We create a RedditDAO to buy a controlling or influencing share of Reddit once it IPOs. With this influence, we not only have a voice in the decisions of the company but protection from potentially harmful policies.

Edit: The level of support for this is outstanding!  I have tried to respond to as many of you as I can. Thank you all for participating in true r/CC fashion. I appreciate the awards, humor, suggestions, and criticisms that have been offered. "

## Christmas Crypto Conversations

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ozhujzsjk7681.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8954a047ccbc32f067b1b9b097fa4ced7f4fe41

It’s a relatively quiet day in the cryptoverse. Price action is slow, and volume is low. It seems things are slowing down for the holidays and is typical around this time of year. People are leaving to visit families, and there is generally less work conducted. Traders and enterprises are also beginning to take profits for the year to either pay taxes or show off gains.

Here is the best thing that can happen to crypto in the coming week or two, and it has nothing to do with price or adoption. [I covered price probabilities yesterday](https://medium.com/@TraderGabi/crypto-market-update-12-16-eoy-bitcoin-price-probabilities-926aa05acfc). All the people going home for Christmas, the executives holding parties and all the friends gathering, will need some interesting new subjects to discuss. I think this year it will be bitcoin, crypto, and buzz topics like NFTs.

Whether it's talked about in a good light or not, the important thing is that the conversation is taking place. Next time the executive is watching CNBC and the bitcoin price shows +6% gain for the day, he'll notice. Once a mother hears her child talking NFTs with a friend, she'll notice. When all the fans enter the former Staples center, soon-to-be Crypto.com center, THEY WILL NOTICE.

Humans are incredibly great at networking. These thoughts about crypto will spread quickly in the mainstream, and once news networks realize the hottest subjects on social media are crypto-related, they'll cater to their customers. My hope for the holidays is that those small dinner discussions on Christmas provide the fuel to help propel crypto into a promising 2022.

## Market Update

&#x200B;

**Bitcoin**  is down **-1.49%** and consolidating. $46.5k is showing signs of support. BTC will come in contact with the downtrend line soon, then it will have to choose to break out or continue lower.  

**Terra (LUNA)** is up **3.27%** as it continues its steady march upwards.

**Harmony One (ONE)** is up +6.32% preceding the launch of its Ethereum bridge scheduled on Monday. So keep an eye on ONE in the coming weeks.

Notable Gainers

* **YEARN +33%**
* **AVAX +10.5%**

## NEWBIES’ Lesson of the day

**Popular Crypto Abbreviations**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a1uu95zwj7681.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=5329d65adabbd91f752ce6fb73f97717461f7e44

 

There's particular jargon specific to crypto like any other community out there. It's not created to make people feel left out but rather to strengthen community ties. I've mentioned a few of these buzzwords in my newsletter so it's time I introduce the newcomers to some of their meanings.

**HODL** – Not to hold but to HODL. It means to not sell your crypto but to hodl for dear life. Rumor has this it this word was created in 2013 by an early developer of Bitcoin who was drunk while messaging.

**DYOR** – DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. This has been used in the newsletter a few times and is very important. Don’t throw all your trust in my newsletter or Youtube influencer, DYOR.

**FUD** – FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, and DOUBT. We all know news profits off fear at this point. If you make it a habit to keep up with news (I got you!) you begin to see patterns of FUD and then elation. Don't buy into FUD. FUD doesn't mean the news isn't accurate, FUD is just highlighting what is created to stir emotion.

**FOMO** – FEAR OF MISSING OUT. All your friends are going to the beach, but you have to work, FOMO! All your co-workers buy Shiba Inu, and you fear not getting rich with them, FOMO! FOMO is here to remind us that FOMO is a strong emotion.

**DEFI** – Decentralized Finance is any decentralized crypto project that offers financial services. Exchanges, Lending/Borrowing dApps, Yield Farms, and even Stablecoin are forms of DeFI. There are many more.

**DEX** – Decentralized Exchange. A peer-to-peer exchange that does not foster a third party as a middleman. **UNISWAP (UNI)** was the first of its kind in 2020, and now there are more than one hundred.

**REKT** – Short version of WRECKED.  To get REKT means to lose a lot of your funds. If you have a bad trade, you can get REKT.

*Can you think of more popular abbreviations or terms?*

125,7,Reddits probably going public. And that’s a good thing for us.,4,rhv0wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rhv0wa/reddits_probably_going_public_and_thats_a_good/,40,1639674209.0,"Now before you jump on me, hear me out. 

Traditional social media has been on a decline for years. Anyone who has used Twitter for more than 10 minutes know it’s just a cesspool of negativity. Facebook is even worse. Just a bunch of Karen’s spouting misinformation.

I saw Reddit as the last social media app that was genuinely out for(mostly) censorship resistant content. Well that’s going to change considering they’re preparing to file for an IPO. 

With the recent DAO hype, I think now is the best time for someone to develop a real decentralized social media website. We have the infrastructure to develop a full on, community governed social media website. Use an L2 like Arbitrum to avoid high gas fees when interacting. Create a separate governance token for proposals. We have the tools to do it. 

I realize there are people trying to create decentralized social media websites. The problems with these is that they’re trying to be just a decentralized Twitter. No. That’s not how we win. We need to create something with a fresh new look. A sleek UI, and a genuinely rewarding experience. 

Take Robinhood for example. Sure, they’ve gone to the shitter in recent years. But their original design was pretty revolutionary at the time. They made it extremely easy to interact with stocks as well as options. 

With the Reddit IPO, I don’t see any other solution. When your entire company is run by investors who only care about their bottom line, you lose long term. We need a platform where users aren’t the product."

## The social platform is seeking an initial public offering of common shares, it said in an announcement Wednesday.

 Reddit has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a proposed initial public offering of its common stock, the company announced on Twitter.

* The numbers of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have yet to be determined, the announcement said.
* The IPO is expected to occur after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market conditions.
* Reddit is in a “quiet period,” and for regulatory reasons cannot disclose more information, the announcement said.
* The social media platform announced in January it was expanding its work with the Ethereum Foundation to provide development resources to scaling tools. In the announcement, posted to the Ethereum subreddit, Reddit employee u/jarins said the move increases the company’s commitment to the technology and echoes its long-held “decentralized ethos.”
* Wednesday’s release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation to buy any securities, Reddit said in a disclaimer.

Reddit has filed its IPO documents, which are now under review, Reuters reports (https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/reddit-files-us-ipo-2021-12-16/)

In keeping with the independent spirit that has made Reddit so successful (its nothing without us Redditors), the powers that be should either give us the opportunity to buy pre-IPO shares like the investment bankers or do a fair launch with no pre-sale. 

Not only would they save a ton of banker fees if they sold direct to the community, but they’d avoid a lengthy roadshow/book building process, and stay true to their mission. 

A fair launch (no pre-sale) has also been a successful strategy for many companies. 

Since demand will be so high just from the Reddit community alone they could also restrict access to MOON and BRICK holders. 

So, how do we get in on what promises to be the most oversubscribed IPO launch in modern memory?"
130,12,How Reddit’s IPO and Expanded Tokenization will affect r/CC,1,rih1pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rih1pq/how_reddits_ipo_and_expanded_tokenization_will/,24,1639746382.0,"First let me preface by saying this is all speculation and anyone who says they know what’s going to happen is a liar (unless they actually know in which case you should listen to them). 

As we all know, not only is crypto volatile, it’s complex and confusing. Sometimes when something seems like a positive catalyst, it’s actually a giant hole in the bottom of the boat. 

But fear not, I am here to help. I have strong reason to believe that Reddit’s IPO and Tokenization will affect our beloved tokens value (note that it is against the rules to trade this token) in one of three ways:

1. Value will increase 

Something will happen that will be good and the value will go up. 

2. Value will decrease 

Unlike option 1, the thing that happens is not good and will actually make the value go not up (i.e. down)

3. Value will stay the same 

It is always possible that many good and not good things will happen that will have no effect at all. Additionally, it’s possible that the total sum of good things is equal to that of not good things, thus cancelling out any positive or negative changes. 

I hope this has helped shed some light on what’s going on and curb some FUD I’ve seen circulating in the sub."

134,16,“Crypto is just another Dot-Com bubble waiting to burst”…,142,rp4fmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rp4fmx/crypto_is_just_another_dotcom_bubble_waiting_to/,242,1640548391.0,"Crypto being just another Dot-com bubble that is waiting to burst is a popular refrain that we hear across reddit subs, social media and from our uncle Larry at family dinner.  Let's assume for argument's sake that this will turn out to be true, should this give us any reason to question why we are all here as active crypto investors? But first, a little bit about the Dot-com bubble.

In the early to mid 1990’s, the internet was rapidly evolving into a form that would be vaguely recognizable to the modern user today.  The use of websites was shifting from a read-only model where you went to a site to read static content, into a more interactive model that allowed users to exchange ideas and content more freely with each other.  The advent of e-commerce was also another huge paradigm shift that was enabled during this period.  By the mid 1990’s it was becoming increasingly clear that there was a new and untapped revenue stream emerging that could be harnessed via e-commerce.  What was not clear however, was how to appropriately value these new opportunities.

Fueled by an mass influx of venture capital, superbowl ads and wishful thinking, the late 1990’s saw massive internet company IPOs created out of virtually nothing with little to no viable products to provide customers.  Some of the most spectacular failures that people commonly associate with this phase are pets.com, webvan.com, and a whole host of other companies that appended .com to their names which you probably have never heard of.  By the year 2000 the market had crashed, resulting in a loss of 5 trillion in market cap by 2002.  Certainly this is a cautionary tale for all of us crypto investors?  Don’t over value speculative assets and companies, and don’t buy into an oversaturated market in the modern day equivalent of late 1999.

However, along with all the jokes about people who invested in drkoop.com, there is another lasting legacy that the dot-com bubble has left us with: The creation of the infrastructure that powers the modern-day internet and everything that runs on it.  Let’s talk for a minute about some other companies that rose out of the dot com bubble.  Amazon.com, founded in 1994 and IPO’d in 1997. Amazon not only takes in $600B+ a year, but also powers a huge chunk on the internet with its AWS service.  Ebay, founded in 1995 and IPO’d in 1998, made peer to peer sales/auctions commonplace.  Google, founded in 1998 and IPO’d in 2004, is the de facto search engine of the internet today.

Back to our question about how we should be thinking about the dot-com bubble in relation to today’s crypto market.  One lesson that the dot com bubble teaches us is that early investments in emerging technologies are crucial to forming a foundation that will provide decades of growth in the future.  Every major company during this time was forced to start forming an “online” strategy and I think it’s very easy to underestimate the impact this had on the growth of the internet in the long run.  Without all the investments made in internet infrastructure during this time, we would not be as far as we are today.  The most exciting part about today’s crypto landscape is that we are watching the foundations of crypto infrastructure being built in front of our very eyes.  Some semblance of what is being built today will be with us for a very long time.  

Secondly, there will be winners and losers in any emerging technology.  While there will be monumental failures ala pets.com, there will also be opportunities to get in on the ground floor of the next amazon or google.  And yes, people that invested in these companies before the bubble burst and held are very very happy with their investments today. This is where your ability to assess a technology and determine for yourself if you believe it has future potential is vitally important.  It’s common to say “do your own research” as a disclaimer for any crypto advice, but you should be asking yourself if each of your investments has potential beyond today’s valuation or the possibility of a random pump tomorrow or next week.  Can you picture your investment powering some segment of the crypto space for years and decades to come? If the answer is yes, you may have found something that not only has the ability to weather a bubble but can emerge as an even better investment on the other side as other solutions fall by the wayside.  So if you’re saying that crypto is the next dot-com bubble, meaning the foundation of a revolutionary tech movement that will have some volatility but will enable exponential growth over the following decades…I say bring it on!"

136,18,"How reddit going public, will affect (existing and future) community tokens",182,rhmjuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rhmjuw/how_reddit_going_public_will_affect_existing_and/,272,1639644055.0,"**This morning (16-12 CET) Reddit confidentially submitted a draft registration to go public.**  
What got my attention is that on this sub, it seemed like it caused a lot bullish thoughts on community tokens like the one we've got. It made me wonder: ""What is this assumption based off? Are there any arguments or examples that point towards this conclusion?"" So I deeply thought about it, so you don't have to: *(TL;DR at the bottom)*

**Community Tokens:**  
Before we get into anything, let’s take a look at what a community token is. 

Community tokens, at the heart of it, are created as a means to gain access to a community. They’re a type of cryptocurrency specifically designed to open the door to a particular digital group. You can think of them like membership cards, but based on the blockchain. 

What the token can do, and what sort of access it offers, fully depends on the project behind it. Each social token represents a community and each community has a different value offer.

So for example Bricks on the Fortnite subreddit or ours.

**Reddit going public:**  
With Reddit going public, a few things are going to happen:

* It's going to get a lot more focused on making profits (Think ads and sponsorships etc)
* It will have more funds to promote and grow its user base

This will result in a lot more active members of subreddits. Now Reddit has already pointed out that it will embrace other subreddits who want to make their own community token so more subreddits will get their own community token and at the same time grow their community with new people joining in as a result of the promoting done with the funds of the IPO. 

With this the first contribution to the community tokens will be made: The Supply and demand basic model. By growing the number of users and only having a set number of tokens will increase the demand. This will result in a growth of the price of these tokens. 

Further more, if more people start earning these community tokens, people who don't use reddit but are into crypto will start looking into these coins as well.   
Look at yourself for example; Most of you don't actually make use of the DOT or ADA blockchain yourself, but because you believe in the project you invest in it anyway. This will be the same with the community coins. 

Now here is the part where I start speculating so don't quote me on this, but:  
If there are going to be substantially more users that are going to engage with community coins, and non reddit users wanting to profit from these projects, it won't stay unnoticed: Big exchanges will pick up on these trends and start looking how they can profit from this, with the answer being: Listing these coins on your exchange. Now if this happens, and I am saying IF, this will be very bullish for the reddit community tokens. It will enable everyone on earth with acces to the exchange to trade our community coins, and it will cause an astronomic rise demand with supply staying the same. This obviously is the most bullish case.

**TL;DR / conclusion:**  
**In the end it all comes down to supply and demand; going public will substantially increase the user base of reddit (because of all the promotion and branding that is gonna be done with the raised money by the IPO). This in turn will increase demand without raising supply, causing a rise in the value of the community tokens. This high demand and low supply will be picked up by big exchanges as an opportunity to profit from it. They will try to list these coins on their exchange. If the succeed to do so, this will be the most bullish case for the community coins, now being available to be easily traded by everyone.**

Or, alternatively, will every subreddit having their own token steal the thunder of our coin?  Will it dilute enthusiasm?  

Bonus subject, what are the chances reddit does away with moons altogether since now they will be scrutinized as a public company?

We will need:

* Software developers

There seems to be confusion as to what was meant by Blockchain-Based.

Here are a few keywords:

* Decentralization (main feature)
* developers and hackers are not able to get the (private) user data. It is at least extremely difficult.
* It is impossible for a hacker to manipulate contributions afterwards
* It is impossible for a person (hacker) to exclude or disenfranchise a user. community has that under its control. (remember why we already have two sub migrations behind us?)
* Example: Loopring donation instead of award."

as you probably already know, [Reddit is planning to go public](https://www.printfriendly.com/p/g/diZuHM).  This could have some reeaally bad consequences for apes if we keep  relying on this platform. This post is to propose a plan, should another  exodus become neccessary.

# 1.: Reddit now

One important thing only few know is who runs Reddit right now. It doesn't use its own servers nor AWS but it's [hosted by Fastly](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/numerous-popular-websites-are-facing-an-outage/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9ndWNlLnRlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHX_4WKhAVe4ARbG_EcIgfS0PbYATBgbBKHuuTKxuJzkiK7zDxFHOB-Lin_CHqluVO07PcnBZICRO97gQuJD-PpFNo15Pyhgl0uu98oXdq4vLhH57gDVnXpkyIN2fakDMusYK0Srdiw_FKdYi43hgc9R3AyHHwt4J0ww25p6KuIL).  Fastly is a service specialized demanding, high-performance hosting and  also provides the servers for other popular services like Pinterest and  Spotify. This means, those are the computers where all our written DD,  all posts, all memes, all fake internet points are stored - and also all  meta data. So whoever controls those servers has access to all user and  traffic data you ever generated on this site - through tracking  services potentially elsewhere, too.

So who is Fastly? The board of directors delivers the first interesting find: [Paula Loop](https://www.theofficialboard.de/biografie/paula-loop-09g87)! She currently holds three director positions:

* PwC US: fair enough
* Fastly: That's how we found her
* **Robinhood: Lo and behold!**

First red flag.

Next step, who owns Fastly? [There is some interesting stuff in there, too](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLY/holders?p=FSLY).

[The usual suspects](https://preview.redd.it/3zx8vpz0wy581.jpg?width=897&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b02022ac6e4fc4b6004550fe81f689c3f2367b2)

Second red flag.

So  we're essentially feeding all our DD to Robinhood, Susquehanna and  Blackrock, right? And we're expecting them to provide the main service  we rely on to communicate. Right. I don't know about you but I don't  need more evidence to see the need for a more secure platform for our  community.

# 2.: Where to?

Color  me weirdo but I think it's not a good idea to go from one commercial,  hedge fund infested platform to another. It should be open source and  decentralized. The most sophisticated and secure platform that functions  like Reddit is [Aether](https://getaether.net/).  There already exist communities for the popular GME related subreddits.  They are mostly inactive right now but still, if a migration should be  necessary, there they are.

Aether  is not a website but decentralized and works P2P - a bit like a  blockchain or Torrents but not really one of those. To access it, you  need to install a dedicated client, create a user and that's it. The  dedicated client provides more security, privacy and transparency than  your general browser and spares you a few clicks if you use a computer.  It doesn't get more secure than that. It's currently available for  Windows, Linux and Mac and an Android App is in the works.

I'm  quite stoked for that network, it's just quite empty for now. But in  case of another exodus, it provides the best options for a new home.

# 3.: Keep calm and carry on

Please  don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting an exodus. This is just to raise  awareness to the dangers on our current platform for serious topics  like MOASS, crimes of the elites or a revolution of the financial  system. People already received death threats and law suits so an  additional layer of security seems quite nice - just in case.

But  until then, there is no immediate need for action. Just, please keep  that in mind. There is a dedicated platform existing that provides the  exact functions we are looking for, there is absolutely no need to go to  YouTube comment sections and wrestle with completely unfit UI.

**TL/DR: Reddit is already quite bad and will very likely become worse for us.** [**Aether**](https://aether.app/) **is the best solution, should another exodus become neccessary.**"

Reddit will not be the same. Its goal now is to provide a platform that engages users while offering up ads for revenue. They have expanded to buying awards, coins, ad-free experience, etc... but when they become public, they will focus primarily on revenue vs the social development of the business. That's just the way the world currently works, unfortunately. 

There is hope, however! I logged on to another social media platform the other day, after months of ignoring it, and discovered that they are shutting down their platform due to lack of developers, funding, and time. It is an open-source platform and they recently published the full code on their Github under the MIT license for anyone to continue where they left off!

I'm not advocating for a mass migration or anything like that, but...! This group has \~700k people here. Many would be capable of developing the platform further and, if the same kind of atmosphere could be kept, it may provide an option in the future. Funding wouldn't likely be an issue based off of what I've seen this past year either. 

The full codebase is here [https://github.com/OkunaOrg](https://github.com/OkunaOrg) and their primary website is/was [https://okuna.io/](https://okuna.io/).

With control over Reddit, it would be possible for them to start spreading mass FUD and shill attacks.

Imagine:

You see your favorite DD author accounts start posting articles that slowly but surely start to deviate from what we've been learning all along.

You think to yourself, you trust the DD, and this author never led you astray, and the changes start so small that you don't even realize they're happening. But is it really the author that is saying these things?

Many other users also are agreeing it seems, who's this anon? Oh he has XXXXX karma? And their history is only SS, GME, LRC? He MUST be legit, I can trust this ""ape"". And on and on it goes.. but is it a REAL account? Remember, they now have complete control over account generation...

Sentiment changes, it spreads throughout the sub (the 50monkeys rule) and what has been worked up to all this time boiling to a point, simmers and pressure is released.

THIS is the real damage. Not the closing of the sub. 

The ultimate FUD and shill attack.

I realize that this post itself can definitely be seen as FUD, and I'm not denying it.

But for the pot to boil over, we must keep the fire burning.

Phone numbers, and European ones at that... That's my floor.

I'm hoping (because I'm not smart enough) that wrinkly apes can figure out a new place for the apes.

We migrated before from wallstreet-bets, to GME, to SS/Jungle, and we're not afraid to do it again.

We're nomads. The fight goes on."

""We're in the endgame now.""  As I have stated before, the clock is ticking, and the clock is not in our favor.  As many of us like to use the word 'zen' as if it justifies inaction, I beg to differ.

Many a great youtuber have been in agreeance on one thing: that shills and infiltrators, inside our open/free forums, are making every attempt to prevent MOASS while engaging in psychological warfare and issuing propaganda.  These shills and infiltrators are actually funded by the same entities who got caught red-handed in their illegal practice of destroying hundreds of American companies by shorting them to death, and while funding the media to force a false sentiment upon the masses.  We know these hedge funds are backed by their brokers, and who brazenly circumnavigate securities laws and financial regulations.  J.P. Morgan and Chase Co just admitted to guilt in their violation of securities laws.  Note: this news was released on a friday (the day where PR teams release news when they want to hide something or minimize their reputational harm).  Also read about Goldman Sachs fraud during the Great Recession, the $600B bailout, and how often the SEC (effectively dirty cops) accept hundred-million dollar deals in lieu of real justice.  Let us be crystal clear: you rarely, if ever, see any of these crooks behind bars where they belong.  They write a check instead.

But this writeup is not meant to become a sob story; I am no gadfly.  I want to discuss Reddit's IPO.

We know that Reddit, and its merit-based and open forum for discourse, was the root cause for January 2021.  Reddit allowed for Keith Gill, who is by fact a bold violator of FINRA regulations himself, to advocate for his stock.  GameStop was his all-in bet, and he advocated for over a year for his position (there were moments when that bet was not going well for him).  Yet, Warren Buffett does the same thing.  ""Advocating for your position"" is one of the long-standing rules of successful investing.  (why do you think Warren in his prime bought out so many news companies?)  Although YouTube and other forums were also used, Reddit allowed for a truthful discourse.  Free humans engaging in discussion, sharing of open information.  Yet, in terms of sentiment (which is the source of financial decision making) Reddit is the 'sentiment casino' itself.  Hedge Funds quickly want to become the Dealers in that casino.  As we know, the casino also wins.  After all, they design the games and their odds of winning.

Yet, on the same day that J.P. Morgan was caught ($200M fine), they issue a 'distraction' all over CNBC?  The distraction to their financial crimes was about short selling.  Why?  Well, because the Department of Justice and SEC are busy right now, as they have stated that there is an active CRIMINAL investigation into short-selling practices, specifically.  Essentially, J.P. Morgan being a broker for Melvin Capital (legal Target) quickly went from Group of Interest to Subject.  They paid a lot of money to avoid prosecution on Friday.  Notice, however, that J.P. Morgan jumped on the news to issue propaganda about their take: that a short squeeze is inevitable now, through Christmas, and into year-end.  Because Federal prosecutors were criminally interviewing J.P. Morgan all week, they likely 'jumped ship' onto the good side and, on the same day of the $200M penalty, spoke in favor (all of a sudden) of a short squeeze.  This is why I believe that there will be no fake squeeze, and instead the one squeeze will simply be MOASS.

Reddit Leadership, on the other hand, has been the sole entity in this saga (and very innocent, mind you) who was not attempting to profit.  Apes (mostly low class, some middle class, and few upper class) want MOASS.  That's profit (advocating for their position). Brokers and Hedge Funds (all upper class and connected with the ruling elite) don't want MOASS (shills advocating for their position).  But, as we spoke about before, the medium for advocating for your position is the real money-maker.  In Warren Buffett's day, it was the newspaper companies.  Today, it's the internet.  For investing, though, Reddit just became the ultimate newspaper company for top investors to try to advocate from. Hedge funds and brokers, therefore, know that this is their only and last chance to infiltrate the source - Reddit - in order for them to try to prevent MOASS.  For these reasons, combined with the fact that FUDelity's $400M was one of the largest and earliest funding in their pre-IPO rounds, I believe Reddit Leadership was solicited.  I believe that Reddit Leadership probably did not want to go public, but that their company became what will forever be known as the battleground for the largest sentiment war for the largest potential transfer of wealth to other societal classes in human history.

And they may have just sold us out for their own gain.  And what is the other problem with this?  Any funds that us Apes use in the quest to buy 51% of Reddit right now are funds not going into GameStop.

With all of this stated, I like the idea of the real MOASS occurring right now, while the prosecution of the Federal Government onto the criminal hedge funds and criminal brokers is clearly so actively hot.  

TLDR;  Reddit Leadership wants to profit from the Apes vs Hedge Fund 'Tug of War.'  Maybe they just wisened up to this spontaneously, or maybe they were given an offer they couldn't refuse?  Reddit is effectively the 'sentiment casino', so who will become the Dealers?  But, the Reddit IPO just became a new financial battleground in the hedge funds' latest, we're-in-the-endgame-now-level distraction to GME.  Thus, only after MOASS occurs, and Ken Griffin is in jail, we can then (and only then) consider diversifying slightly from our GME positions and into the modern day newspaper companies like Reddit, where we can forever-ensure fairness and equal opportunity in the sharing of free, public information."

**I have gotten a few requests to help out and also many who wish to be a part of it.** Obviously we can't continue here, so comment on this post and if there is indeed enough interest, perhaps we start a Discord and talk next steps to create a Web 3.0 Dapp. *Or let it die in new —* *It's up to you folks!*

Note: I am having a hard time getting a hold of u/dit-k and that's alright, maybe they're just busy.

***Edit: We have 80 people who have joined the Discord so far with lots of ideas being shared. It's awesome to see ideas melding and direction forming***"

**Quick Note from a Crayon Eatin' Dick Puncher**

Hello Apes - u/happy_dick_punch here. You might know me from my previous hits around glitches, shitposting memes, dropping some music covers, kicking around the banter or just eating some crayons round here.

Long story short, I’ve also got a background in digital. Been having some good discussions this past week related to the Reddit IPO stuff, backups, preserving, archiving and then considering the future. I own [gmeforever.com](http://gmeforever.com/) and offered that as a space if we want to think about utilizing it as a future house for whatever.

Ok, This post is about archiving all the folks who are talking and volunteering and want to consider collaborating. Putting this list together so you apes can have a place of reference to find, connect, engage, volunteer and hopefully keep things rolling. Lots of talented little silverback brains in here.

Been seeing and involved in a few discussions over the past week around building backups of our beloved home here on r/SuperStonk and preserving the archives while also considering how we might move forward in the future.

There have been great discussions and talking with people and seeing all the amazing talent.

I scraped a bunch of posts, comments and people who raised their hands to put together a list for organizing and archiving everyone who wants to be involved in various little projects, etc around digital, data, development, design, etc.

Below are some posts I have scraped with usernames.

Everyone be on your best behavior. Everyone with global market weights up front, preferably those with significant bond holdings as that community skews older and more risk averse. Those holding crypto and individual stocks in the back.


But seriously, welcome to anyone taking a look here who usually hangs out on the forum. I hope we can be as useful on Reddit as I have found the bogleheads forum to be all this time. Anyone unaware of the forum should take a look over there too. Lots of good discussion to be had."
162,0,Negativity around Reddit's IPO is loaded with bias.,37,rho3z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rho3z0/negativity_around_reddits_ipo_is_loaded_with_bias/,134,1639651006.0,"It's very similar bias to what a Chicago native will speak on Portillos being a public company - they feel so at home with the product that they feel comfortable critiquing it, despite being a regular customer.

I study Metaverse and social media investments and am greatly looking forward to Reddit's IPO.


In my view, the future of Reddit is going to be deeper focus in it's subreddit communities. The CEO is on record saying it looks up to Roblox's community model of game creators (subreddit owners) and players (posts/comments)


In my view, Reddit going public isn't going to be some advertising nightmare for consumers. That part happened years ago when Reddit focused on mobile. Reddit is going to focus on content creation and getting subreddits more active with incentives.

For example, Roblox has engagement based payouts for games, where the creator is paid based on time spent in a game. How much of your time on Reddit is spent on a few subreddits?

I'm also fascinated with how much redditors are willing to spend on digital goods on this app. I think we will soon see a Reddit marketplace that we aren't really expecting too.



I'm really excited for this and Im going all in along with Block for 2022."
163,1,Reddit monetization after IPO,114,rkfjmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rkfjmx/reddit_monetization_after_ipo/,77,1639977765.0,"Hi all,

Something I've been thinking about lately is Reddit going Public. 

A big reason companies IPO is to cash out or sellout to become billionaires*.  Usually the company grows and becomes worth a lot more, however the platform changes dramatically.  The once private company, then focuses on the balance sheet and pinches pennies and pushes revenue boosting tactics.  

Take Facebook or YouTube as an example.  Facebook was a decent social networking platform before they became public.  Also, didn't use predatorial tactics to keep our attention before.  I remember when I could watch videos on YouTube for hours... Now google wants to show us videos they want us to watch.  

I've watched Reddit also change the past couple years. 

I'm disappointed like your dads disappointment.  

Reddit is going to change, and it's not going to be the better.   They are Sellouts.  You will see ads on top of ads and features be restricted/ removed. 

An alternative of Reddit will surface, I will be waiting...."
164,2,Reddit Files Confidentially for IPO Social media company says in blog post it filed paperwork with SEC to go public.,12,rhli2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/rhli2j/reddit_files_confidentially_for_ipo_social_media/,24,1639639616.0,"Most recently, the company announced that it had raised a $700 million round in August 2021 at a valuation of more than $10 billion. The social media company did not make the filing publicly available. The company also did not say how many shares would be offered nor the price range for the proposed offering.

Although Reddit was created in 2005, it has taken a unique road toward going public.

Conde Nast Publications acquired Reddit in 2006. The social media services remained a part of the publication company until it was made an independent subsidiary in 2011. Since then, it raised a series of funding rounds from venture capital firms. 

Reddit Inc. is considering ways to make its share offering more accessible to individual investors as it plans to go public, Chief Executive Steve Huffman said.

Mr. Huffman the market is evolving in a way that makes it easier for even small investors to buy into new offerings, he said at The Wall Street Journal’s Tech Live conference Monday. It is often difficult for individual investors to buy into hot initial public offerings. “I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our shareholders to be users,” Mr. Huffman said at the conference, which the Journal hosted virtually with top executives."

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 17, 2021**

Stocks extended Thursday’s losses, with the market ending a volatile week in the red as market participants continued to digest ongoing risk surrounding the Omicron variant and the Fed’s new monetary policy, which signaled a faster rate of taper and interest rate hikes next year. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.02%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.50%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.42%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.92% 
* Volatility Index: +3.19%
* JP Morgan (JPM): -2.28%
* Oracle (ORCL): -6.39%
* AMC: +19.22%
* FedEx (FDX): 4.95%
* Rivian (RIVN): -10.26%

The main focus of market participants remains on the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision, with the Central Bank doubling the pace of tapering and suggestions that the interest rate may be raised three times in 2022.

The potential for higher rates continues to weigh heavily on technology and growth stocks whose valuations rely heavily on future earnings potential. In the last month, the Nasdaq has fallen by -3.43% and the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 8.32% in the last month.

On the other hand, cyclical stocks in the energy and financials sectors outperformed on Thursday, with the prospects of higher interest rates and stronger growth seen as benefiting these sectors. The Dow Jones (DIA) has only lost -1.23% in the month and has been trending upwards in December. As always, it’s important to balance a portfolio with both growth and value stocks.

Troy Gayeski, Chief Market Strategist at F5 Investments, said “The thing investors have to understand is, we're going through a major transition in monetary policy. The Fed has been running emergency policies arguably far longer than they should have been, and as that money supply growth slows down as they ease off the balance sheet expansion and ultimately hike next year, one would at least expect more volatility in markets. And that's really what we've been seeing the last month."" 

**Highlights** 

* The Biden administration on Friday recommended the Federal Communications Commission grant Alphabet's Google and Facebook-parent Meta licenses for an undersea cable.
* The companies entered into national security agreements to protect data on the Pacific Light Cable Network system, an undersea fiber optic cable system that will connect the United States, Taiwan and the Philippines.
* Tesla Inc was hit by a lawsuit over CEO Elon Musk's social media posts including his Twitter poll on stock sales that pulled down its stock prices. Investor David Wagner called for access to internal documents to investigate whether Tesla and Musk failed to adhere to fiduciary duties
* Rivian stock gapped down another roughly 11%  after the company reported earnings that showed steep losses and said it expects to fall “a few hundred vehicles short of its 1,200 production target for this year.
* Alibaba Deputy CFO Toby Xu, making his first major public remarks since being named this month to take over as CFO, said that international e-commerce ""will become one of the key growth drivers"", adding that 57% of revenue for Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics unit, comes from overseas.
* Reddit announced it was filing for an IPO with an estimated $15 billion valuation. I love the platform but I think they’ll have a hard time monetizing users.
* Rivian also announced it was planning to build a new factory in Georgia in order to boost production
* Kellogg’s has reached a new tentative agreement with its 1,400 striking cereal plant workers that could bring an end to the strike that began Oct. 5."

# [Stock futures little changed after the Dow notches a record close](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mixed in early morning trading Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a record close the previous day as investors flocked to shares that stand to benefit from an economic recovery.
*****
> Futures on the blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 were flat, while Nasdaq 100 futures moved 0.3% lower.
*****
> Early losers included Dow component Salesforce, which fell more than 2% in premarket trading following a downgrade from UBS, which also cut Adobe, sending its shares down 1.8%.
*****
> Markets also faced pressure from stocks associated with the economic reopening: Wynn Resorts fell 2%, while Las Vegas Sands was off 1.5%. With Covid cases rising, pharma companies were under pressure, with Regeneron down 3% following a downgrade from Bank of America.
*****
> The moves come as investors look for clues on where the economy stood heading into the new year.
*****
> ADP will be out with its monthly private payrolls count at 8:15 a.m., with the Dow Jones estimate at 375,000 for December. That report will come ahead of Friday’s more closely watched nonfarm payrolls count, which is expected to show a gain of 422,000.
*****
> Investors also awaited the release of minutes from the December Federal Reserve meeting. Policymakers decided then to accelerate the pace of the monthly bond buying taper and indicated that three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes are coming in 2022. They also adjusted their outlook on inflation and economic growth.
*****
> However, the market will be looking for additional information on where officials see policy heading, particularly on what will happen with the Fed’s nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
> On Tuesday, while the Dow climbed 200 points to a new high, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite suffered a sell-off, down 1.3%, amid a rapid rise in Treasury yields. The closely-watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was as high as 1.71% Tuesday, triggering selling in growth-oriented technology stocks.
*****
> Megacap tech stocks underperformed the S&P 500 Tuesday as “investors reconsidered the value of such long-duration assets in the wake of higher rates,” Chris Hussey, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said in a note.
*****
> “The Fed is accelerating its removal of liquidity because inflation has broadened, which has the potential to push 10-year yields higher,” Ed Al-Hussainy, senior rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle, said in a note. “But the central bank must be careful not to act too aggressively, which could derail the economic recovery and cause a recession.”
*****
> Wall Street strategists are expecting a bumpier road ahead for the stock market as the Fed begins to tighten its ultra-easy monetary policy. The median year-end target for the S&P 500 now stands at 5,050, only a 5% gain from Tuesday’s close of 4,793.54, according to CNBC’s Strategist Survey.

# [Dow futures nudge higher after Wednesday’s Fed-induced sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Dow futures edged higher in early trading Thursday, recovering after worries over tighter monetary policy led to the first losing regular trading session of the year.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 104 points, or 0.29%. S&P 500 futures were little changed and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.37%.
*****
> Energy shares helped boost the market in early action as crude prices rose 1.5%. Marathon Oil gained 2.6%, Occidental Petroleum was up 2.2% and ExxonMobil rose 1.3%.
*****
> Rate-sensitive stocks also were higher a day after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting revealed the central bank is getting ready to remove its economic help more more quickly than anticipated. Officials discussed reducing the Fed’s balance sheet in another move to dial back its pandemic-era easy monetary policy.
*****
> Bank of America saw its shares increase 1.5% premarket and Citigroup rose 1.4% and Wells Fargo gained 1.3%.
*****
> The Fed’s plan to reduce the number of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities it holds comes as it is already tapering its bond purchases and is set to hike interest rates after the taper concludes.
*****
> “Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate,” the minutes stated.
*****
> Stocks slid following the release of the minutes. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 392.54 points, or 1.07%, lower after hitting an intraday record earlier in the session. The S&P 500 fell 1.94%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw its biggest one-day loss since February, losing 3.34%.
*****
> The Fed update also pushed the 10-year yield to above 1.75%. It ended last year at 1.51%.
*****
> “If you ride a wave of liquidity to the upside and that liquidity starts to go away, I don’t think it’s terribly surprising that you’re going to see a reaction,” said Kathy Jones, head of fixed income at Charles Schwab.
*****
> “This was the year we were going to transition from extremely easy monetary policy and fiscal policy to less easy monetary and less expansive fiscal policy. That has to have some impact on risk assets that have risen because the discount rate was so low,” Jones added.
*****
> All 11 S&P 500 sectors fell in Wednesday’s session.
*****
> Elsewhere Thursday, shares of Allbirds rallied more than 4% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the shoe brand, whose stock has struggled since it went public in November.
*****
> Investors await quarterly earnings reports from Walgreens Boots Alliance and Bed Bath & Beyond before the bell Thursday.
*****
> On the data front, the weekly jobless claims report is slated for released Thursday morning. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect that claims totaled 195,000 for the week ended Jan. 1. Trade balance data is also due, with economists looking for the deficit in goods and services to total $81.5 billion.
*****
> The releases come a day ahead of the Labor Department’s key nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show that the economy added 422,000 jobs in December. However, payroll processing firm ADP reported Wednesday that companies added a much higher-than-expected 807,000 positions for the month, indicating a possible upside surprise to Friday’s count from the department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.

# [Stock futures turn higher after the S&P 500 hits another record](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/27/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
> U.S. stocks were poised to build on record highs in the final week of the year as futures rose Tuesday morning.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added about 90 points, while those for the S&P 500 gained 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 were up 0.5%.
*****
> The move in futures comes after stocks rallied in Monday’s regular session, with the S&P 500 rising roughly 1.4% to close at a record high. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4%, while the Dow climbed about 352 points.
*****
> Markets continued to look to pandemic news for direction.
*****
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Monday that it was shortening its isolation recommendation for people who test positive to five days from 10, if those people do not have symptoms.
*****
> Research out of South Africa also indicated that omicron infections can help boost immunity to the earlier delta strain of Covid.
*****
> Pharmaceutical stocks dipped in early trading following the relatively optimistic news on the pandemic. Moderna slipped 1.6% and Pfizer was marginally lower in light premarket trading Tuesday morning.
*****
> Stocks dipped in late November, in part because of the rise of the omicron variant of Covid-19, but have since rebounded as governments have largely shied away from reinstating lockdowns and strict social distancing measures.
*****
> Airline stocks did struggle on Monday, however, as the spread of the virus led to hundreds of flight cancelations around the Christmas holiday. Apple also announced that it was closing its New York City stores to customers due to the spike in Covid cases.
*****
> Stocks tend to rise in light trading during the final days of the year, often called the “Santa Claus rally.” However, many Wall Street pros predict relatively small gains for stocks in 2022 after two strong years.
*****
> “If you look around Wall Street, you see very tame expectations, and it’s probably a reflection that we’re probably pretty late in the cycle,” Jim Lacamp, senior vice president at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said on “Closing Bell.”
*****
> In addition to the S&P 500′s record close, the Dow is within 1% of its intraday all-time high, while the Nasdaq is about 2% below its high-water mark.
*****
> For the year, the S&P 500 is up 27.6% for the year and the Nasdaq is up 23.1%. The Dow is the laggard, up 18.6%.
*****
> It is a slow week overall for economic data, but investors will get a look at home prices on Tuesday when the October reading for the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index is released before the bell.

# [Dow futures up 200 points following Fed decision to aggressively wind down asset purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/stock-futures-market-open-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose sharply in early Thursday trading after the Federal Reserve signaled it would be aggressive on tapering and sees three interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped about 222 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.7% each.
*****
> Shares of companies that have done well in previous rate-hiking cycles led premarket gainers. Materials stocks FMC Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan both rose more than 3% ahead of the opening bell. Bank stocks also rose across the board, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America all up about 0.6%.
*****
> In transportation news, Delta Air Lines reported that it now expects to see a profit of $200 million in the fourth quarter, after previously projecting a loss. Shares rose 2.2% on the news.
*****
> In other central banking news, the Bank of England announced it is hiking its key policy rate by 15 basis points to 0.25%. Markets were awaiting a separate policy decision from the European Central Bank. There also is more economic news on tap, with weekly jobless claims and housing starts out at 8:30 a.m. ET.
*****
> Following the Fed news, traders accelerated their own expectations for interest rate increases. Fed funds futures trading now points to a 63% chance of the first quarter-percentage-point increase coming in May 2022, with chances also rising to about 44% that the central bank could make its first move as soon as March, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
*****
> Stocks traded in negative territory throughout the regular session Wednesday and turned higher ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference in the afternoon at the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Dow added 383 points, or 1.08%. The S&P 500 rose 1.63% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.15%.
*****
> “The fact that the FOMC acknowledged new COVID variants as a threat to the economic recovery that could alter policy going forward, as well as the generally optimistic tone from Powell in the presser, helped spark a relief rally as the Fed meeting was viewed as being not-as-hawkish-as-feared,” Tom Essaye of the Sevens Report said in a note on Thursday.
*****
> The Fed will begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases in January and buy just $60 billion of bonds each month going forward, compared to $90 billion in the month of December. That decision follows recent inflation data showing a 6.8% surge in November, which is higher than expected and the fastest rate since 1982.
*****
> “The notion that elevated inflation levels would be transitory has finally been thrown out the window by the Fed and the latest policy adjustments are reflective of a committee that doesn’t want to miss the next train leaving the station,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
*****
> Health-care stocks UnitedHealth and Amgen gained ground Wednesday, rising 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively.
*****
> Adobe and Accenture are scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the opening bell. FedEx and Rivian will report after the bell.

# [Stock futures slip lower ahead of key inflation data, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures were marginally lower during morning trading Tuesday after the major averages started the week in the red as Covid omicron fears hit sentiment.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 futures declined 0.13% while and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by nearly 0.5%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced between gains and losses.
*****
> Tesla shares were among the biggest early droppers on the S&P 500, falling 2.3% premarket after CEO Elon Musk announced that that he has sold another $906.5 million in shares.
*****
> Fellow automaker Ford also fell, down 2.2% following news that by 2030 Toyota would be investing $35 billion into battery-powered electronic vehicles, a space where Ford has sought to establish itself as a leader. Toyota itself declined even more, with shares off 3.4% premarket.
*****
> Pfizer shares rose nearly 1% after final results of tests on its Covid drug showed it reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 89% in high-risk patients.
*****
> The market will get fresh inflation data Tuesday when November’s producer price index number is reported. Economists are expecting it to show that prices rose 0.5% for the month, according to estimates from Dow Jones. This would be a slight slowdown from October’s 0.6% increase.
*****
> The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.
*****
> Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday that he thinks the central bank should start raising rates soon.
*****
> “The Federal Reserve would be better off storing away some of rate increases, so when the inevitable turn down comes, you’ve got some ammunition to fight with,” he said. “At the moment, at zero interest rates, we have no ammunition.”
*****
> Investors will be watching closely for commentary around if the Fed plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank’s asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.
*****
> “So far the bond market has given the Fed a pass on inflation — whether it will continue to do so is in doubt,” noted Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. “The real fireworks coming from the meeting are likely to be around expectations for rate hikes in 2022,” he added.
*****
> The latest CNBC Fed Survey showed that investment professionals and economists expect the Fed to wind down its asset purchases by March and begin rate hikes in June.
*****
> During trading Monday, the Dow slid 0.89%, or 320 points, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.39% as investors rotated out of technology stocks with high valuations.
*****
> Shares of airlines and cruise line operators declined amid fears that the omicron variant could slow travel.
*****
> While equities fell broadly on Monday, growth areas of the market underperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF dipped 1.22%, while the iShares Russell 1,000 Value ETF declined 0.45%.
*****
> Despite Monday’s decline for equities, the S&P 500 is roughly 1.6% below its Nov. 22 all-time intraday high. The Dow is 2.5% below its record, while the Nasdaq Composite is about 5% under its high-water mark. The Russell 2000 index is down a sharper 11.3% since its Nov. 8 high.
*****
> Looking forward, some strategists, including LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick, believe there’s upside ahead for equities.
*****
> “We believe pent-up demand, gradual improvement in supply chain challenges, solid labor force growth, and productivity gains will all contribute to another year of above-trend economic growth in 2022,” he wrote in a note to clients. “COVID-19-related risks remain and the potential for a policy mistake may be elevated as the economy moves towards normalization, but we think the overall environment will be supportive of business growth and ultimately equity markets,” he added.

# [Stock futures are little changed ahead of key Fed decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-key-fed-decision-.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were little changed in early morning trading on Wednesday as investors readied for Wednesday’s highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision.
*****
> Dow futures gained 8 points. S&P 500 futures were flat, and the Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%.
*****
> The Fed will conclude its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and the public will hear from central bank Chairman Jerome Powell at a 2:30 p.m. ET news conference.
*****
> The Fed is grappling with the highest inflation level in 39 years and the central bank is widely expected to announce an acceleration of the tapering of its bond-buying program, which was put in place during the pandemic to prop up the economy.
*****
> “Investors remain on a buyers strike in front of the FOMC meeting,” Fundstrat’s Tom Lee wrote in a note. “Tapering is not the ‘hawkish pivot’ that ends bull markets, but it is a hawkish pivot relative to the massive easing since the pandemic started. So we think this buyers strike in front of FOMC could turn into a ‘buy the event.’”
*****
> This sets the stage for a dramatic policy shift that will clear the way for a first interest rate hike next year.
*****
> A CNBC Fed Survey predicts the Fed will double the pace of the taper to $30 billion at its December meeting, which would end the $120 billion in monthly asset purchases by about March. The central bank will then hike rates three times in each of the next two years, starting in June 2022, the survey respondents predict.
*****
> “While the chairman is not likely to suggest any specific timeframe for when the funds rate will begin to be lifted, he probably will confirm that some members do want to move more quickly than previously announced in raising interest rates,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.
*****
> “I would not expect the Fed to say much that is not already anticipated by the financial markets,” Paulsen added. “Some of the recent stock market volatility may lessen after this two-day meeting and its press conference is finally concluded.”
*****
> On the political front, congressional Democrats passed a bill raising the debt ceiling, sending it to President Joe Biden early Wednesday just under the wire for when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government would run out of spending power.
*****
> On Tuesday, the major averages slipped, exacerbated by selling in software names like Microsoft and Adobe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 106 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.75%.
*****
> The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.1% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.
*****
> Also hurting sentiment Tuesday was the hotter-than-expected inflation reading for November’s producer price index showing a year-over-year increase of 9.6%, the fastest pace on record. This was above the 9.2% expected by economists, according to Dow Jones. The index rose 0.8% month over month, above the 0.5% expected.
*****
> While the Fed meeting is in focus, investors are also monitoring the new Covid variant omicron. The World Health Organization on Tuesday warned the new Covid-19 omicron variant is spreading faster than any previous strain, and is likely in most countries of the world.
*****
> November’s retail sales data is slated to release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting that retail sales rose 0.8% in November, compared to October’s growth of 1.7%, according to the Commerce Department.

# [S&P 500 looks set to add to its record close from Friday with futures higher](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> S&P 500 futures rose early Monday after the index notched its best week since February at a fresh record close, rebounding from a big sell-off triggered by fears of the omicron coronavirus variant.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded 40 points higher, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures inched up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.34%.
*****
> Moderna shares were among the strongest gainers premarket Monday, rising 2.4% a day after the White House’s top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci called Covid booster shots “optimal care,” but said the definition of fully vaccinated would not change.
*****
> Elsewhere, Apple moved closer in its quest to become the market’s first $3 trillion company, gaining 1% premarket following an upgrade from JP Morgan.
*****
> Also, chipmaker Nvidia, which has become a signature reopening trade, was up 1.7% on optimism that omicron would not be as disruptive as initially thought.
*****
> The early Monday action followed a strong week on Wall Street as investors shrugged off a hot inflation reading. The blue-chip Dow gained 4% last week, breaking a four-week losing streak with its best weekly performance since March. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively, last week, both posting their best weekly performance since early February.
*****
> Investors digested a jump in headline inflation data, which came in at 6.8% in November year-over-year for the biggest surge since 1982. The print was marginally higher than the 6.7% Dow Jones estimate.
*****
> “The fact is that inflation is likely to remain on the higher side for a while and risks of sticky inflation remain, although we believe that the passing of base effects and the easing of supply chain constraints by the end of the first quarter of next year should slowly bring inflation down to more comfortable levels,” Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in a note.
*****
> The key inflation reading came ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting this week where the policymakers are expected to discuss speeding up the end of its bond-buying program.
*****
> Fed Chair Jerome Powell, as well as a parade of Fed speakers, all recently suggested the central bank could end the $120 billion monthly bond purchase program sooner than the current timeline of June 2022.
*****
> “We believe markets can continue take a higher inflation reading in their stride, though additional volatility remains a risk. With Fed policy staying relatively accommodative, the backdrop for equities is still positive, and we favor winners from global growth,” said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer of UBS Global Wealth Management.
*****
> Stocks bounced back last week as investors bet that the initial worry about the Covid strain is overblown. Many also took solace in the news from Pfizer and BioNTech that a study found three doses of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the variant.
*****
> As of Sunday, the U.S. was approaching 800,000 coronavirus-related deaths. The new variant has pushed some government officials to reinstate health restrictions to slow the spread.

176,0,We should create a DAO and buy Reddit once it IPOs,3278,rjl893,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rjl893/we_should_create_a_dao_and_buy_reddit_once_it_ipos/,940,1639876127.0,"This idea is a modification of a r/WSB post I saw earlier today. We all know that crypto technology is the future and where better to display this technology than through Reddit. This is a rough idea ( kind of a joke but interesting to think about nonetheless) that I would love the community's input on.

Reddit recently filed a confidential report with the SEC marking its first step toward an IPO. According to Forbes, Reddit's most recent funding round yielded $700 Million, which puts the companies value at around $10 Billion. Most companies offer a limited number of shares at any given time. These shares are usually common stock which gives investors a right to vote and earn dividends (if dividends are offered). The right to vote is the important part. If an individual or group can buy a majority \[ 50% plus 1\] of a company's voting stock, known as a controlling equity interest, then that individual or group has significant influence in the operating decisions of the company. However, a majority is not always required and significant influence can be achieved through owning a plurality of voting shares.

This is where a DAO comes in. I think we all remember the ConstitutionDAO that valiantly tried to buy one of the 13 copies of the U.S Constitution. In what was our crypto National Treasure moment, we were presented with a real-world example of the power of crypto technology. Thousands of individuals, ""The People"", participated to fundraise money and buy a piece of history. A RedditDAO could attempt a similar feat, but instead of buying an artifact, we could buy a controlling share of Reddit. We could all have a voice on the board of a publically traded company. We would be able to influence strategic and operational changes that impact Reddit users (all of us). Instead of being at the whims of management, we could become a part of management.

I neither know the legal behind a DAO having a seat on the board of a publically traded company nor do I know the steps toward creating a DAO, but If someone with the know-how and resources does then this could be an interesting endeavor.

For those of you that didn't labor through the paragraphs above here is the TLDR:

TLDR: We create a RedditDAO to buy a controlling or influencing share of Reddit once it IPOs. With this influence, we not only have a voice in the decisions of the company but protection from potentially harmful policies.

Edit: The level of support for this is outstanding!  I have tried to respond to as many of you as I can. Thank you all for participating in true r/CC fashion. I appreciate the awards, humor, suggestions, and criticisms that have been offered. "
177,1,"If you opened your Vault, it’s time to close off your account with 2FA",251,rkdzui,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rkdzui/if_you_opened_your_vault_its_time_to_close_off/,234,1639972457.0,"With Reddit expanding their karma = tokens cryptocurrency experiment while simultaneously applying for an IPO(becoming a publicly traded company), now more than ever you need to setup Two Factor Authentication (2FA).  

Eyes are on Reddit now, in fact eyes might even be on your vault. So if you want to keep those precious moons you earned while shamelessly shitposting, you need to setup 2FA yesterday.  

You can setup 2FA easily through settings, you can use Authy or Google, both work fine.  

I’m sure many of you don’t protect your Reddit accounts with the best password, and I’m equally sure many of you signed up with an old email that you barely even use anymore, how strong is that password?  

Don’t become a sob story post. Protect your Moons.

178,2,"How reddit going public, will affect (existing and future) community tokens",177,rhmjuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rhmjuw/how_reddit_going_public_will_affect_existing_and/,272,1639644055.0,"**This morning (16-12 CET) Reddit confidentially submitted a draft registration to go public.**  
What got my attention is that on this sub, it seemed like it caused a lot bullish thoughts on community tokens like the one we've got. It made me wonder: ""What is this assumption based off? Are there any arguments or examples that point towards this conclusion?"" So I deeply thought about it, so you don't have to: *(TL;DR at the bottom)*

**Community Tokens:**  
Before we get into anything, let’s take a look at what a community token is. 

Community tokens, at the heart of it, are created as a means to gain access to a community. They’re a type of cryptocurrency specifically designed to open the door to a particular digital group. You can think of them like membership cards, but based on the blockchain. 

What the token can do, and what sort of access it offers, fully depends on the project behind it. Each social token represents a community and each community has a different value offer.

So for example Bricks on the Fortnite subreddit or ours.

**Reddit going public:**  
With Reddit going public, a few things are going to happen:

* It's going to get a lot more focused on making profits (Think ads and sponsorships etc)
* It will have more funds to promote and grow its user base

This will result in a lot more active members of subreddits. Now Reddit has already pointed out that it will embrace other subreddits who want to make their own community token so more subreddits will get their own community token and at the same time grow their community with new people joining in as a result of the promoting done with the funds of the IPO. 

With this the first contribution to the community tokens will be made: The Supply and demand basic model. By growing the number of users and only having a set number of tokens will increase the demand. This will result in a growth of the price of these tokens. 

Further more, if more people start earning these community tokens, people who don't use reddit but are into crypto will start looking into these coins as well.   
Look at yourself for example; Most of you don't actually make use of the DOT or ADA blockchain yourself, but because you believe in the project you invest in it anyway. This will be the same with the community coins. 

Now here is the part where I start speculating so don't quote me on this, but:  
If there are going to be substantially more users that are going to engage with community coins, and non reddit users wanting to profit from these projects, it won't stay unnoticed: Big exchanges will pick up on these trends and start looking how they can profit from this, with the answer being: Listing these coins on your exchange. Now if this happens, and I am saying IF, this will be very bullish for the reddit community tokens. It will enable everyone on earth with acces to the exchange to trade our community coins, and it will cause an astronomic rise demand with supply staying the same. This obviously is the most bullish case.

**TL;DR / conclusion:**  
**In the end it all comes down to supply and demand; going public will substantially increase the user base of reddit (because of all the promotion and branding that is gonna be done with the raised money by the IPO). This in turn will increase demand without raising supply, causing a rise in the value of the community tokens. This high demand and low supply will be picked up by big exchanges as an opportunity to profit from it. They will try to list these coins on their exchange. If the succeed to do so, this will be the most bullish case for the community coins, now being available to be easily traded by everyone.**   


Interested how you guys see this."
179,3,“Crypto is just another Dot-Com bubble waiting to burst”…,144,rp4fmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rp4fmx/crypto_is_just_another_dotcom_bubble_waiting_to/,242,1640548391.0,"Crypto being just another Dot-com bubble that is waiting to burst is a popular refrain that we hear across reddit subs, social media and from our uncle Larry at family dinner.  Let's assume for argument's sake that this will turn out to be true, should this give us any reason to question why we are all here as active crypto investors? But first, a little bit about the Dot-com bubble.

In the early to mid 1990’s, the internet was rapidly evolving into a form that would be vaguely recognizable to the modern user today.  The use of websites was shifting from a read-only model where you went to a site to read static content, into a more interactive model that allowed users to exchange ideas and content more freely with each other.  The advent of e-commerce was also another huge paradigm shift that was enabled during this period.  By the mid 1990’s it was becoming increasingly clear that there was a new and untapped revenue stream emerging that could be harnessed via e-commerce.  What was not clear however, was how to appropriately value these new opportunities.

Fueled by an mass influx of venture capital, superbowl ads and wishful thinking, the late 1990’s saw massive internet company IPOs created out of virtually nothing with little to no viable products to provide customers.  Some of the most spectacular failures that people commonly associate with this phase are pets.com, webvan.com, and a whole host of other companies that appended .com to their names which you probably have never heard of.  By the year 2000 the market had crashed, resulting in a loss of 5 trillion in market cap by 2002.  Certainly this is a cautionary tale for all of us crypto investors?  Don’t over value speculative assets and companies, and don’t buy into an oversaturated market in the modern day equivalent of late 1999.

However, along with all the jokes about people who invested in drkoop.com, there is another lasting legacy that the dot-com bubble has left us with: The creation of the infrastructure that powers the modern-day internet and everything that runs on it.  Let’s talk for a minute about some other companies that rose out of the dot com bubble.  Amazon.com, founded in 1994 and IPO’d in 1997. Amazon not only takes in $600B+ a year, but also powers a huge chunk on the internet with its AWS service.  Ebay, founded in 1995 and IPO’d in 1998, made peer to peer sales/auctions commonplace.  Google, founded in 1998 and IPO’d in 2004, is the de facto search engine of the internet today.

Back to our question about how we should be thinking about the dot-com bubble in relation to today’s crypto market.  One lesson that the dot com bubble teaches us is that early investments in emerging technologies are crucial to forming a foundation that will provide decades of growth in the future.  Every major company during this time was forced to start forming an “online” strategy and I think it’s very easy to underestimate the impact this had on the growth of the internet in the long run.  Without all the investments made in internet infrastructure during this time, we would not be as far as we are today.  The most exciting part about today’s crypto landscape is that we are watching the foundations of crypto infrastructure being built in front of our very eyes.  Some semblance of what is being built today will be with us for a very long time.  

Secondly, there will be winners and losers in any emerging technology.  While there will be monumental failures ala pets.com, there will also be opportunities to get in on the ground floor of the next amazon or google.  And yes, people that invested in these companies before the bubble burst and held are very very happy with their investments today. This is where your ability to assess a technology and determine for yourself if you believe it has future potential is vitally important.  It’s common to say “do your own research” as a disclaimer for any crypto advice, but you should be asking yourself if each of your investments has potential beyond today’s valuation or the possibility of a random pump tomorrow or next week.  Can you picture your investment powering some segment of the crypto space for years and decades to come? If the answer is yes, you may have found something that not only has the ability to weather a bubble but can emerge as an even better investment on the other side as other solutions fall by the wayside.  So if you’re saying that crypto is the next dot-com bubble, meaning the foundation of a revolutionary tech movement that will have some volatility but will enable exponential growth over the following decades…I say bring it on!"

## The social platform is seeking an initial public offering of common shares, it said in an announcement Wednesday.

 Reddit has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a proposed initial public offering of its common stock, the company announced on Twitter.

* The numbers of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have yet to be determined, the announcement said.
* The IPO is expected to occur after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market conditions.
* Reddit is in a “quiet period,” and for regulatory reasons cannot disclose more information, the announcement said.
* The social media platform announced in January it was expanding its work with the Ethereum Foundation to provide development resources to scaling tools. In the announcement, posted to the Ethereum subreddit, Reddit employee u/jarins said the move increases the company’s commitment to the technology and echoes its long-held “decentralized ethos.”
* Wednesday’s release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation to buy any securities, Reddit said in a disclaimer.

181,5,To all the folks thinking $1 or $2 price for moons is the end goal - you're missing the big picture,33,rpyzmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rpyzmb/to_all_the_folks_thinking_1_or_2_price_for_moons/,282,1640643630.0,"I know, I know, your daily dose of hopium and whatnot.

Just think about it. It had the price $0.4 in August. Without a mainnet, without a use case, without an entity behind them that's going to IPO soon (if you [missed the news](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/reddit-ipo/)). All of those are in the pipeline, and really soon. The price was $0.4, 40% of ""dream price"", with being available only on two smallish swap sites. With daily volume of a few thousand of $. Without anyone (besides people here) knowing about them.

Doge has the marketcap of $25 billion. No one in their right mind would think this is possible just a year ago. It's a joke, for Satoshi's sake. It did not have a whitepaper a week ago. It just started, and against all odds started going up, giving tremendous return to the holders that thought of it as a joke.

Sure, Doge was one of the first meme coins and practically no one can top their meme coin status. Except Shib did just a few weeks/months ago. Of all the meme coins, Shib did it (this makes no sense, but that's a different topic).

So, Moons have a max supply of 250 mill (I'm, for the sake of being on the conservative side, not including the burned tokens and project for the full 250mil, even though not all of them are on the blockchain yet). For them to reach that kind of mcap ($25B), they'd need to have a price of around $100. That's right, over 800x from where it is now.

Insert Keannu ""Woah"" gif, I know. Hear me out, though.

Now, who's to say Moons cannot do that? Even the almighty ETH had a smaller mcap than that during 2018. Which is exactly my point. The total crypto mcap is $2.5 trillion, and topped around $3 trillion this year. When it's growing, it's insane. There is not a single reason why moons cannot do that (that Doge and Shib have not overcome).

If/when Moons get on the mainnet, and if/when they develop a solid use case for them, I don't see a single reason why it could not be at that mcap. Doge and Shib did it without a use case. And without a legal entity behind them, preparing for an IPO. But it's most likely gonna be (sorry for the downer) the next bull run, not this one."

Reddit recently filed for an IPO and will soon become a publicly traded company.  Amongst some of their future plans is to roll out a type of cryptocurrency for many or maybe even all of their popular subreddits.

Will this help our current moons ""moon"" due to having 1st mover advantage?  Are moons the bitcoin of reddit?  ....and if so, how long will us early adopters hold?  I can imagine lots of selling pressure at $1 if we ever get there.  

Or, alternatively, will every subreddit having their own token steal the thunder of our coin?  Will it dilute enthusiasm?  

Bonus subject, what are the chances reddit does away with moons altogether since now they will be scrutinized as a public company?  


Interesting times ahead.  I know we collectively can only speculate, but i am curious about the communities thoughts 🤔."

As you already know, Reddit is preparing to become public company with around 15 Billion Dollar Valuation:

https://www.investopedia.com/reddit-files-for-ipo-5213473

On other side, Reddit is preparing to extend its Cryptocurrency project- Reddit Community Points which launched in May 2020 for 2 subreddits:

https://www.reddit.com/community-points

*It looks like they choose WSB as demonstration in the graphics with Token that looks like Dimond.


If big subreddits gets their own economics and token, this will create value for each subreddit and it can be adding even more value to the current Reddit Valuation or even backing it.


For now there are 2 subreddits with Tokens :
r/Cryptocurrency MOON - $15M MC. 
Fortnite BRICK - $3M Market Cap.

Note that these are on testnet and there should be 0 value for testnet tokens, on mainnet everything will change and we might see serious increase in valuation.

Now think about 10-20 big subreddits with big market valuation on mainnet. Think about it, DogToken or Shiba are valued around 10-30 Billion $ each while whole Reddit valuation is 15 Billion.

What can WSB or r/Cryptocurrency Token bring to the table? Millions of Redditors will involved and it can endup real big Win for Reddit and Redditors.

&#x200B;

I know that this question is very subjective and contextual in the sense that it depends on personal circumstance/situations (financial or other). Just interested to know what you guys think.

Reddit has filed its IPO documents, which are now under review, Reuters reports (https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/reddit-files-us-ipo-2021-12-16/)

In keeping with the independent spirit that has made Reddit so successful (its nothing without us Redditors), the powers that be should either give us the opportunity to buy pre-IPO shares like the investment bankers or do a fair launch with no pre-sale. 

Not only would they save a ton of banker fees if they sold direct to the community, but they’d avoid a lengthy roadshow/book building process, and stay true to their mission. 

A fair launch (no pre-sale) has also been a successful strategy for many companies. 

Since demand will be so high just from the Reddit community alone they could also restrict access to MOON and BRICK holders. 

So, how do we get in on what promises to be the most oversubscribed IPO launch in modern memory?"

## Christmas Crypto Conversations

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ozhujzsjk7681.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8954a047ccbc32f067b1b9b097fa4ced7f4fe41

It’s a relatively quiet day in the cryptoverse. Price action is slow, and volume is low. It seems things are slowing down for the holidays and is typical around this time of year. People are leaving to visit families, and there is generally less work conducted. Traders and enterprises are also beginning to take profits for the year to either pay taxes or show off gains.

Here is the best thing that can happen to crypto in the coming week or two, and it has nothing to do with price or adoption. [I covered price probabilities yesterday](https://medium.com/@TraderGabi/crypto-market-update-12-16-eoy-bitcoin-price-probabilities-926aa05acfc). All the people going home for Christmas, the executives holding parties and all the friends gathering, will need some interesting new subjects to discuss. I think this year it will be bitcoin, crypto, and buzz topics like NFTs.

Whether it's talked about in a good light or not, the important thing is that the conversation is taking place. Next time the executive is watching CNBC and the bitcoin price shows +6% gain for the day, he'll notice. Once a mother hears her child talking NFTs with a friend, she'll notice. When all the fans enter the former Staples center, soon-to-be Crypto.com center, THEY WILL NOTICE.

Humans are incredibly great at networking. These thoughts about crypto will spread quickly in the mainstream, and once news networks realize the hottest subjects on social media are crypto-related, they'll cater to their customers. My hope for the holidays is that those small dinner discussions on Christmas provide the fuel to help propel crypto into a promising 2022.

## Market Update

&#x200B;

**Bitcoin**  is down **-1.49%** and consolidating. $46.5k is showing signs of support. BTC will come in contact with the downtrend line soon, then it will have to choose to break out or continue lower.  

**Terra (LUNA)** is up **3.27%** as it continues its steady march upwards.

**Harmony One (ONE)** is up +6.32% preceding the launch of its Ethereum bridge scheduled on Monday. So keep an eye on ONE in the coming weeks.

**Polkadot (DOT)** continues to get beat **down -4.38%**, despite the upcoming Parachain launch.

Notable Gainers

* **YEARN +33%**
* **AVAX +10.5%**
* **EWT  +6%**
* **CTX   +46%**

The rest of the market is a relatively mixed bag.

## Major Crypto News 12.17

* [Social Network Reddit has announced it will go public and is filing for an IPO with a valuation of $15 billion.](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/reddit-ipo/) In addition, Reddit has plans to incorporate cryptocurrency into its Karma voting system, already testing on three subreddits.

Nevertheless, there is growing pressure from crypto entities and government officials to allow this style of ETF into the market.
* [The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has realized its annual report noting stablecoins and defi pose a growing risk to the U.S. Financial System.](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/17/financial-stability-group-warns-of-stablecoin-defi-risks-in-annual-report/) If regulation begins coming down on stablecoins, expect decentralized stablecoin demand to rise.

**Harmony One (ONE)** is launching a trustless Ethereum bridge on Monday. This is huge news for the layer-1 smart contract platform. ONE has many upgrades scheduled in the near term.

&#x200B;

 

## NEWBIES’ Lesson of the day

**Popular Crypto Abbreviations**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a1uu95zwj7681.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=5329d65adabbd91f752ce6fb73f97717461f7e44

 

There's particular jargon specific to crypto like any other community out there. It's not created to make people feel left out but rather to strengthen community ties. I've mentioned a few of these buzzwords in my newsletter so it's time I introduce the newcomers to some of their meanings.

**HODL** – Not to hold but to HODL. It means to not sell your crypto but to hodl for dear life. Rumor has this it this word was created in 2013 by an early developer of Bitcoin who was drunk while messaging.

**DYOR** – DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. This has been used in the newsletter a few times and is very important. Don’t throw all your trust in my newsletter or Youtube influencer, DYOR.

**FUD** – FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, and DOUBT. We all know news profits off fear at this point. If you make it a habit to keep up with news (I got you!) you begin to see patterns of FUD and then elation. Don't buy into FUD. FUD doesn't mean the news isn't accurate, FUD is just highlighting what is created to stir emotion.

**FOMO** – FEAR OF MISSING OUT. All your friends are going to the beach, but you have to work, FOMO! All your co-workers buy Shiba Inu, and you fear not getting rich with them, FOMO! FOMO is here to remind us that FOMO is a strong emotion.

**DEFI** – Decentralized Finance is any decentralized crypto project that offers financial services. Exchanges, Lending/Borrowing dApps, Yield Farms, and even Stablecoin are forms of DeFI. There are many more.

**DEX** – Decentralized Exchange. A peer-to-peer exchange that does not foster a third party as a middleman. **UNISWAP (UNI)** was the first of its kind in 2020, and now there are more than one hundred.

**REKT** – Short version of WRECKED.  To get REKT means to lose a lot of your funds. If you have a bad trade, you can get REKT.

*Can you think of more popular abbreviations or terms?*

Reddit is actually working on what seems to be a DAO, Decentralised Autonomous Organisation

Reddit are decentralising their own platform by introducing Reddit Community Points to certain subreddits, this is done by tokenizing Karma - each month users gets tokens equivalent to their Karma (Posts and Comments in the subreddit), this number gets reduced by 2.5% each month until all tokens are minted 2035 approximately.

This experiment launched (Beta / Testnet) on May 2020 with rCryptocurrency and rFortnite subreddits being involved (Moons and Bricks).As a community we have been the Beta testers of this for quite some time now. Some of us have made some beautiful unrealised gains with Moons and farming with shitposts. At the moment there are 200k+ unique holders for these Community Points.

Arguably moons have changed the community a lot, whether its for the best or not is up to each individual. I have enjoyed this experiment and have also made some nice profits

[https://www.reddit.com/community-points/documentation/introduction](https://www.reddit.com/community-points/documentation/introduction)

[https://www.reddit.com/community-points](https://www.reddit.com/community-points)

**What is the usage of these points?**

1. Voting Power in Governance Polls that changes the subreddit rules.
2. Tipping between users on Reddit.
3. Buying premium Membership on Reddit.
4. Converting Points to Reddit Tokens.
5. Buying Budgets and items on Reddit.

**What is unique about this?**

True ownership, once you receive the tokens, no one can take them from you or manipulate them, even Reddit themselves. Just like with our moons

Reddit Community Points can be traded like any other tokens! Imagine WSB getting unique tokens for its holders - Like Joseph Lubin said “If you think GME story is wild, wait until Reddit Tokens launch on Mainnet “.

Traditional social media has been on a decline for years. Anyone who has used Twitter for more than 10 minutes know it’s just a cesspool of negativity. Facebook is even worse. Just a bunch of Karen’s spouting misinformation.

I saw Reddit as the last social media app that was genuinely out for(mostly) censorship resistant content. Well that’s going to change considering they’re preparing to file for an IPO. 

With the recent DAO hype, I think now is the best time for someone to develop a real decentralized social media website. We have the infrastructure to develop a full on, community governed social media website. Use an L2 like Arbitrum to avoid high gas fees when interacting. Create a separate governance token for proposals. We have the tools to do it. 

I realize there are people trying to create decentralized social media websites. The problems with these is that they’re trying to be just a decentralized Twitter. No. That’s not how we win. We need to create something with a fresh new look. A sleek UI, and a genuinely rewarding experience. 

Take Robinhood for example. Sure, they’ve gone to the shitter in recent years. But their original design was pretty revolutionary at the time. They made it extremely easy to interact with stocks as well as options. 

With the Reddit IPO, I don’t see any other solution. When your entire company is run by investors who only care about their bottom line, you lose long term. We need a platform where users aren’t the product."

As we all know, not only is crypto volatile, it’s complex and confusing. Sometimes when something seems like a positive catalyst, it’s actually a giant hole in the bottom of the boat. 

But fear not, I am here to help. I have strong reason to believe that Reddit’s IPO and Tokenization will affect our beloved tokens value (note that it is against the rules to trade this token) in one of three ways:

1. Value will increase 

Something will happen that will be good and the value will go up. 

2. Value will decrease 

Unlike option 1, the thing that happens is not good and will actually make the value go not up (i.e. down)

3. Value will stay the same 

It is always possible that many good and not good things will happen that will have no effect at all. Additionally, it’s possible that the total sum of good things is equal to that of not good things, thus cancelling out any positive or negative changes. 

I hope this has helped shed some light on what’s going on and curb some FUD I’ve seen circulating in the sub."

Sources have told Reuters that the company is aiming for a valuation above $15 billion which will be interesting to see if/when reddit goes public.  Reddit’s valuation doubled to $6 in February as a result of wallstreetbets and the gamestop and amc short squeezes. In August the company was valued at $10 billion in a private fundraising round.  Opinions on the IPO tend to believe that the company will join other tech companies in trading at a premium due to rapidly growing revenues.

# [Stock futures little changed after the Dow notches a record close](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/04/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mixed in early morning trading Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a record close the previous day as investors flocked to shares that stand to benefit from an economic recovery.
*****
> Futures on the blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 were flat, while Nasdaq 100 futures moved 0.3% lower.
*****
> Early losers included Dow component Salesforce, which fell more than 2% in premarket trading following a downgrade from UBS, which also cut Adobe, sending its shares down 1.8%.
*****
> Markets also faced pressure from stocks associated with the economic reopening: Wynn Resorts fell 2%, while Las Vegas Sands was off 1.5%. With Covid cases rising, pharma companies were under pressure, with Regeneron down 3% following a downgrade from Bank of America.
*****
> The moves come as investors look for clues on where the economy stood heading into the new year.
*****
> ADP will be out with its monthly private payrolls count at 8:15 a.m., with the Dow Jones estimate at 375,000 for December. That report will come ahead of Friday’s more closely watched nonfarm payrolls count, which is expected to show a gain of 422,000.
*****
> Investors also awaited the release of minutes from the December Federal Reserve meeting. Policymakers decided then to accelerate the pace of the monthly bond buying taper and indicated that three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes are coming in 2022. They also adjusted their outlook on inflation and economic growth.
*****
> However, the market will be looking for additional information on where officials see policy heading, particularly on what will happen with the Fed’s nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
> On Tuesday, while the Dow climbed 200 points to a new high, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite suffered a sell-off, down 1.3%, amid a rapid rise in Treasury yields. The closely-watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was as high as 1.71% Tuesday, triggering selling in growth-oriented technology stocks.
*****
> Megacap tech stocks underperformed the S&P 500 Tuesday as “investors reconsidered the value of such long-duration assets in the wake of higher rates,” Chris Hussey, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said in a note.
*****
> “The Fed is accelerating its removal of liquidity because inflation has broadened, which has the potential to push 10-year yields higher,” Ed Al-Hussainy, senior rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle, said in a note. “But the central bank must be careful not to act too aggressively, which could derail the economic recovery and cause a recession.”
*****
> Wall Street strategists are expecting a bumpier road ahead for the stock market as the Fed begins to tighten its ultra-easy monetary policy. The median year-end target for the S&P 500 now stands at 5,050, only a 5% gain from Tuesday’s close of 4,793.54, according to CNBC’s Strategist Survey.

*****
> The U.S. has reported more than 52 million total cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Driving the surge is the omicron variant, which took over as the dominant strain earlier this month.
*****
> A slew of economic data on Thursday last week showed a stable economy with improving labor and spending trends, but inflation at high levels. The Federal Reserve’s closely watched core personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.6% in November from the month prior. Core PCE rose 4.7% year-over-year in November, higher than the 4.5% rate expected.

# [Dow futures nudge higher after Wednesday’s Fed-induced sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Dow futures edged higher in early trading Thursday, recovering after worries over tighter monetary policy led to the first losing regular trading session of the year.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 104 points, or 0.29%. S&P 500 futures were little changed and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.37%.
*****
> Energy shares helped boost the market in early action as crude prices rose 1.5%. Marathon Oil gained 2.6%, Occidental Petroleum was up 2.2% and ExxonMobil rose 1.3%.
*****
> Rate-sensitive stocks also were higher a day after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting revealed the central bank is getting ready to remove its economic help more more quickly than anticipated. Officials discussed reducing the Fed’s balance sheet in another move to dial back its pandemic-era easy monetary policy.
*****
> Bank of America saw its shares increase 1.5% premarket and Citigroup rose 1.4% and Wells Fargo gained 1.3%.
*****
> The Fed’s plan to reduce the number of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities it holds comes as it is already tapering its bond purchases and is set to hike interest rates after the taper concludes.
*****
> “Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate,” the minutes stated.
*****
> Stocks slid following the release of the minutes. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 392.54 points, or 1.07%, lower after hitting an intraday record earlier in the session. The S&P 500 fell 1.94%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw its biggest one-day loss since February, losing 3.34%.
*****
> The Fed update also pushed the 10-year yield to above 1.75%. It ended last year at 1.51%.
*****
> “If you ride a wave of liquidity to the upside and that liquidity starts to go away, I don’t think it’s terribly surprising that you’re going to see a reaction,” said Kathy Jones, head of fixed income at Charles Schwab.
*****
> “This was the year we were going to transition from extremely easy monetary policy and fiscal policy to less easy monetary and less expansive fiscal policy. That has to have some impact on risk assets that have risen because the discount rate was so low,” Jones added.
*****
> All 11 S&P 500 sectors fell in Wednesday’s session.

*****
> Investors await quarterly earnings reports from Walgreens Boots Alliance and Bed Bath & Beyond before the bell Thursday.
*****
> On the data front, the weekly jobless claims report is slated for released Thursday morning. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect that claims totaled 195,000 for the week ended Jan. 1.

However, payroll processing firm ADP reported Wednesday that companies added a much higher-than-expected 807,000 positions for the month, indicating a possible upside surprise to Friday’s count from the department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.

# [Stock futures are little changed ahead of key Fed decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-key-fed-decision-.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were little changed in early morning trading on Wednesday as investors readied for Wednesday’s highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision.
*****
> Dow futures gained 8 points. S&P 500 futures were flat, and the Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%.
*****
> The Fed will conclude its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and the public will hear from central bank Chairman Jerome Powell at a 2:30 p.m. ET news conference.
*****
> The Fed is grappling with the highest inflation level in 39 years and the central bank is widely expected to announce an acceleration of the tapering of its bond-buying program, which was put in place during the pandemic to prop up the economy.
*****
> “Investors remain on a buyers strike in front of the FOMC meeting,” Fundstrat’s Tom Lee wrote in a note. “Tapering is not the ‘hawkish pivot’ that ends bull markets, but it is a hawkish pivot relative to the massive easing since the pandemic started. So we think this buyers strike in front of FOMC could turn into a ‘buy the event.’”
*****
> This sets the stage for a dramatic policy shift that will clear the way for a first interest rate hike next year.
*****
> A CNBC Fed Survey predicts the Fed will double the pace of the taper to $30 billion at its December meeting, which would end the $120 billion in monthly asset purchases by about March. The central bank will then hike rates three times in each of the next two years, starting in June 2022, the survey respondents predict.
*****
> “While the chairman is not likely to suggest any specific timeframe for when the funds rate will begin to be lifted, he probably will confirm that some members do want to move more quickly than previously announced in raising interest rates,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.
*****
> “I would not expect the Fed to say much that is not already anticipated by the financial markets,” Paulsen added. “Some of the recent stock market volatility may lessen after this two-day meeting and its press conference is finally concluded.”
*****
> On the political front, congressional Democrats passed a bill raising the debt ceiling, sending it to President Joe Biden early Wednesday just under the wire for when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government would run out of spending power.
*****
> On Tuesday, the major averages slipped, exacerbated by selling in software names like Microsoft and Adobe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 106 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.75%.
*****
> The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.1% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.
*****
> Also hurting sentiment Tuesday was the hotter-than-expected inflation reading for November’s producer price index showing a year-over-year increase of 9.6%, the fastest pace on record. This was above the 9.2% expected by economists, according to Dow Jones. The index rose 0.8% month over month, above the 0.5% expected.
*****
> While the Fed meeting is in focus, investors are also monitoring the new Covid variant omicron. The World Health Organization on Tuesday warned the new Covid-19 omicron variant is spreading faster than any previous strain, and is likely in most countries of the world.
*****
> November’s retail sales data is slated to release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting that retail sales rose 0.8% in November, compared to October’s growth of 1.7%, according to the Commerce Department.

204,6,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, December 17, 2021",14,ris5xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/ris5xl/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_friday_december/,24,1639778965.0," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 17, 2021**

Stocks extended Thursday’s losses, with the market ending a volatile week in the red as market participants continued to digest ongoing risk surrounding the Omicron variant and the Fed’s new monetary policy, which signaled a faster rate of taper and interest rate hikes next year. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.02%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.50%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.42%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.92% 
* Volatility Index: +3.19%
* JP Morgan (JPM): -2.28%
* Oracle (ORCL): -6.39%
* AMC: +19.22%
* FedEx (FDX): 4.95%
* Rivian (RIVN): -10.26%

The main focus of market participants remains on the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision, with the Central Bank doubling the pace of tapering and suggestions that the interest rate may be raised three times in 2022.

The potential for higher rates continues to weigh heavily on technology and growth stocks whose valuations rely heavily on future earnings potential. In the last month, the Nasdaq has fallen by -3.43% and the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 8.32% in the last month.

On the other hand, cyclical stocks in the energy and financials sectors outperformed on Thursday, with the prospects of higher interest rates and stronger growth seen as benefiting these sectors. The Dow Jones (DIA) has only lost -1.23% in the month and has been trending upwards in December. As always, it’s important to balance a portfolio with both growth and value stocks.

Troy Gayeski, Chief Market Strategist at F5 Investments, said “The thing investors have to understand is, we're going through a major transition in monetary policy. The Fed has been running emergency policies arguably far longer than they should have been, and as that money supply growth slows down as they ease off the balance sheet expansion and ultimately hike next year, one would at least expect more volatility in markets. And that's really what we've been seeing the last month."" 

**Highlights** 

* The Biden administration on Friday recommended the Federal Communications Commission grant Alphabet's Google and Facebook-parent Meta licenses for an undersea cable.
* The companies entered into national security agreements to protect data on the Pacific Light Cable Network system, an undersea fiber optic cable system that will connect the United States, Taiwan and the Philippines.
* Tesla Inc was hit by a lawsuit over CEO Elon Musk's social media posts including his Twitter poll on stock sales that pulled down its stock prices. Investor David Wagner called for access to internal documents to investigate whether Tesla and Musk failed to adhere to fiduciary duties
* Rivian stock gapped down another roughly 11%  after the company reported earnings that showed steep losses and said it expects to fall “a few hundred vehicles short of its 1,200 production target for this year.
* Alibaba Deputy CFO Toby Xu, making his first major public remarks since being named this month to take over as CFO, said that international e-commerce ""will become one of the key growth drivers"", adding that 57% of revenue for Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics unit, comes from overseas.
* Reddit announced it was filing for an IPO with an estimated $15 billion valuation. I love the platform but I think they’ll have a hard time monetizing users.
* Rivian also announced it was planning to build a new factory in Georgia in order to boost production
* Kellogg’s has reached a new tentative agreement with its 1,400 striking cereal plant workers that could bring an end to the strike that began Oct. 5."

# [Stock futures turn higher after the S&P 500 hits another record](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/27/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
> U.S. stocks were poised to build on record highs in the final week of the year as futures rose Tuesday morning.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added about 90 points, while those for the S&P 500 gained 0.3% and the Nasdaq 100 were up 0.5%.
*****
> The move in futures comes after stocks rallied in Monday’s regular session, with the S&P 500 rising roughly 1.4% to close at a record high. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4%, while the Dow climbed about 352 points.
*****
> Markets continued to look to pandemic news for direction.
*****
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Monday that it was shortening its isolation recommendation for people who test positive to five days from 10, if those people do not have symptoms.
*****
> Research out of South Africa also indicated that omicron infections can help boost immunity to the earlier delta strain of Covid.
*****
> Pharmaceutical stocks dipped in early trading following the relatively optimistic news on the pandemic. Moderna slipped 1.6% and Pfizer was marginally lower in light premarket trading Tuesday morning.
*****
> Stocks dipped in late November, in part because of the rise of the omicron variant of Covid-19, but have since rebounded as governments have largely shied away from reinstating lockdowns and strict social distancing measures.
*****
> Airline stocks did struggle on Monday, however, as the spread of the virus led to hundreds of flight cancelations around the Christmas holiday. Apple also announced that it was closing its New York City stores to customers due to the spike in Covid cases.
*****
> Stocks tend to rise in light trading during the final days of the year, often called the “Santa Claus rally.” However, many Wall Street pros predict relatively small gains for stocks in 2022 after two strong years.
*****
> “If you look around Wall Street, you see very tame expectations, and it’s probably a reflection that we’re probably pretty late in the cycle,” Jim Lacamp, senior vice president at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said on “Closing Bell.”
*****
> In addition to the S&P 500′s record close, the Dow is within 1% of its intraday all-time high, while the Nasdaq is about 2% below its high-water mark.
*****
> For the year, the S&P 500 is up 27.6% for the year and the Nasdaq is up 23.1%. The Dow is the laggard, up 18.6%.
*****
> It is a slow week overall for economic data, but investors will get a look at home prices on Tuesday when the October reading for the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index is released before the bell.

# [Stock futures slip lower ahead of key inflation data, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures were marginally lower during morning trading Tuesday after the major averages started the week in the red as Covid omicron fears hit sentiment.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 futures declined 0.13% while and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by nearly 0.5%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced between gains and losses.
*****
> Tesla shares were among the biggest early droppers on the S&P 500, falling 2.3% premarket after CEO Elon Musk announced that that he has sold another $906.5 million in shares.
*****
> Fellow automaker Ford also fell, down 2.2% following news that by 2030 Toyota would be investing $35 billion into battery-powered electronic vehicles, a space where Ford has sought to establish itself as a leader. Toyota itself declined even more, with shares off 3.4% premarket.
*****
> Pfizer shares rose nearly 1% after final results of tests on its Covid drug showed it reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 89% in high-risk patients.
*****
> The market will get fresh inflation data Tuesday when November’s producer price index number is reported. Economists are expecting it to show that prices rose 0.5% for the month, according to estimates from Dow Jones. This would be a slight slowdown from October’s 0.6% increase.
*****
> The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.
*****
> Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday that he thinks the central bank should start raising rates soon.
*****
> “The Federal Reserve would be better off storing away some of rate increases, so when the inevitable turn down comes, you’ve got some ammunition to fight with,” he said. “At the moment, at zero interest rates, we have no ammunition.”
*****
> Investors will be watching closely for commentary around if the Fed plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank’s asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.
*****
> “So far the bond market has given the Fed a pass on inflation — whether it will continue to do so is in doubt,” noted Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. “The real fireworks coming from the meeting are likely to be around expectations for rate hikes in 2022,” he added.
*****
> The latest CNBC Fed Survey showed that investment professionals and economists expect the Fed to wind down its asset purchases by March and begin rate hikes in June.
*****
> During trading Monday, the Dow slid 0.89%, or 320 points, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.39% as investors rotated out of technology stocks with high valuations.
*****
> Shares of airlines and cruise line operators declined amid fears that the omicron variant could slow travel.
*****
> While equities fell broadly on Monday, growth areas of the market underperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF dipped 1.22%, while the iShares Russell 1,000 Value ETF declined 0.45%.
*****
> Despite Monday’s decline for equities, the S&P 500 is roughly 1.6% below its Nov. 22 all-time intraday high. The Dow is 2.5% below its record, while the Nasdaq Composite is about 5% under its high-water mark. The Russell 2000 index is down a sharper 11.3% since its Nov. 8 high.
*****
> Looking forward, some strategists, including LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick, believe there’s upside ahead for equities.
*****
> “We believe pent-up demand, gradual improvement in supply chain challenges, solid labor force growth, and productivity gains will all contribute to another year of above-trend economic growth in 2022,” he wrote in a note to clients. “COVID-19-related risks remain and the potential for a policy mistake may be elevated as the economy moves towards normalization, but we think the overall environment will be supportive of business growth and ultimately equity markets,” he added.

# [S&P 500 looks set to add to its record close from Friday with futures higher](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> S&P 500 futures rose early Monday after the index notched its best week since February at a fresh record close, rebounding from a big sell-off triggered by fears of the omicron coronavirus variant.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded 40 points higher, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures inched up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.34%.
*****
> Moderna shares were among the strongest gainers premarket Monday, rising 2.4% a day after the White House’s top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci called Covid booster shots “optimal care,” but said the definition of fully vaccinated would not change.
*****
> Elsewhere, Apple moved closer in its quest to become the market’s first $3 trillion company, gaining 1% premarket following an upgrade from JP Morgan.
*****
> Also, chipmaker Nvidia, which has become a signature reopening trade, was up 1.7% on optimism that omicron would not be as disruptive as initially thought.
*****
> The early Monday action followed a strong week on Wall Street as investors shrugged off a hot inflation reading. The blue-chip Dow gained 4% last week, breaking a four-week losing streak with its best weekly performance since March. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively, last week, both posting their best weekly performance since early February.
*****
> Investors digested a jump in headline inflation data, which came in at 6.8% in November year-over-year for the biggest surge since 1982. The print was marginally higher than the 6.7% Dow Jones estimate.
*****
> “The fact is that inflation is likely to remain on the higher side for a while and risks of sticky inflation remain, although we believe that the passing of base effects and the easing of supply chain constraints by the end of the first quarter of next year should slowly bring inflation down to more comfortable levels,” Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in a note.
*****
> The key inflation reading came ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting this week where the policymakers are expected to discuss speeding up the end of its bond-buying program.
*****
> Fed Chair Jerome Powell, as well as a parade of Fed speakers, all recently suggested the central bank could end the $120 billion monthly bond purchase program sooner than the current timeline of June 2022.
*****
> “We believe markets can continue take a higher inflation reading in their stride, though additional volatility remains a risk. With Fed policy staying relatively accommodative, the backdrop for equities is still positive, and we favor winners from global growth,” said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer of UBS Global Wealth Management.
*****
> Stocks bounced back last week as investors bet that the initial worry about the Covid strain is overblown. Many also took solace in the news from Pfizer and BioNTech that a study found three doses of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the variant.
*****
> As of Sunday, the U.S. was approaching 800,000 coronavirus-related deaths. The new variant has pushed some government officials to reinstate health restrictions to slow the spread.

# [Dow futures up 200 points following Fed decision to aggressively wind down asset purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/stock-futures-market-open-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures rose sharply in early Thursday trading after the Federal Reserve signaled it would be aggressive on tapering and sees three interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped about 222 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.7% each.
*****
> Shares of companies that have done well in previous rate-hiking cycles led premarket gainers. Materials stocks FMC Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan both rose more than 3% ahead of the opening bell. Bank stocks also rose across the board, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America all up about 0.6%.
*****
> In transportation news, Delta Air Lines reported that it now expects to see a profit of $200 million in the fourth quarter, after previously projecting a loss. Shares rose 2.2% on the news.
*****
> In other central banking news, the Bank of England announced it is hiking its key policy rate by 15 basis points to 0.25%. Markets were awaiting a separate policy decision from the European Central Bank. There also is more economic news on tap, with weekly jobless claims and housing starts out at 8:30 a.m. ET.
*****
> Following the Fed news, traders accelerated their own expectations for interest rate increases. Fed funds futures trading now points to a 63% chance of the first quarter-percentage-point increase coming in May 2022, with chances also rising to about 44% that the central bank could make its first move as soon as March, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
*****
> Stocks traded in negative territory throughout the regular session Wednesday and turned higher ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference in the afternoon at the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Dow added 383 points, or 1.08%. The S&P 500 rose 1.63% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.15%.
*****
> “The fact that the FOMC acknowledged new COVID variants as a threat to the economic recovery that could alter policy going forward, as well as the generally optimistic tone from Powell in the presser, helped spark a relief rally as the Fed meeting was viewed as being not-as-hawkish-as-feared,” Tom Essaye of the Sevens Report said in a note on Thursday.
*****
> The Fed will begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases in January and buy just $60 billion of bonds each month going forward, compared to $90 billion in the month of December. That decision follows recent inflation data showing a 6.8% surge in November, which is higher than expected and the fastest rate since 1982.
*****
> “The notion that elevated inflation levels would be transitory has finally been thrown out the window by the Fed and the latest policy adjustments are reflective of a committee that doesn’t want to miss the next train leaving the station,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
*****
> Health-care stocks UnitedHealth and Amgen gained ground Wednesday, rising 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively.
*****
> Adobe and Accenture are scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the opening bell. FedEx and Rivian will report after the bell.

209,0,"With mainstream talk of a future US civil war, there are some things you should keep in mind",2145,rjy5rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/rjy5rc/with_mainstream_talk_of_a_future_us_civil_war/,942,1639925201.0,"***TL;DR:*** **The US will not be in conventional war with itself. If anything, it is going to Balkanize. It will be ugly and not a good time.**

Few people want to read books on reddit so I am going to keep this one short(er). If you want the long version, I [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/m1duoa/the_united_states_is_following_a_pattern_of/)^1 [them](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/oj18x4/an_examination_of_modern_conflict_an_analysis_of/)^2 [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/oj1al6/an_examination_of_modern_conflict_an_analysis_of/)^3 If you don't like reading, Robert Evans' podcast ""It Could Happen Here"" is a good introduction to these concepts. All sources are linked at the bottom.

Anyway, the term ""civil war"" has been in mainstream new cycle as of late. Of course many people balk at this idea because they cannot imagine this happening. It must be impossible in today's modern world with all its complexities. The problem is that those people still view ""war"" in the way it happened in the 1940s: two big sides, attacks and counter-attacks over lines on a map, money and fuel and infantry on the ground trying to outlast each other, etc. It doesn't work like that. War hasn't worked like that for at least the past 50 years.

The signs of a coming civil collapse can be watered down to four indicators:

**1. Freedom and rights are disappearing.**

The two wings of our neoliberal political system have refused to return liberties to common people and have only intensified their assault on the unalienable rights in the Declaration of Independence: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. Healthcare, the right to one's own body, a living wage allowing one to own a house.

**2. Polarization, hate, and violence are on the rise.**

The 2024 presidential campaign started on January 20, 2021 at 12:00. [White supremacy is now mainstream.](http://archive.vn/INs2W)^4

**3. Access to information is limited.**

An information silo is a business management term for information that is self-contained and walled off from everything else. I'm not getting into business jargon here, so think of it like a grain silo. Yes, that giant tube with a dome on top next to a barn. It's full of grain and on the top you can even stand on it (don't do that). It looks good, sturdy, stable, just like a new theory you are exposed to. But if you start poking around, there are a lot of holes, cavities, voids. If one of those collapses, then you go down. You go down and you're done. Just like that. Or maybe you get chest deep, but then you're still stuck. All of the grain, the little bits of theory, the information is so much pressure on you that can't get out. You can't pull yourself out and people can see you but they can't really help either. If you are thrown a rope and enough people try, then may they pull you out. However, the forces of grain on your body may crush you anyway in the process. The way out takes professional help; someone with the proper tools to build blockers around you, so that the pressure is gone and they can safely move you out.

We have tens of millions of the US population living in alternates realities. These thousands of grains of conspiracy theories and actual foreign propaganda are stuck together through lies and gaslighting, or what is now cutely called ""misinformation"". It has become profitable to keep people in these information silos. [Reddit is about to IPO.](http://archive.vn/Hmoc5)^5 That means that like Facebook and YouTube, it will be flooded with ""fact checkers"" and censures and guidance to keep what is on it appropriate for capital inventors and advertisers.

**4. The behavior of people in the know.**

This is what people are noticing now. People who study extremism saw the writing on the wall at end of 2020. The rest of the country saw it in January 2021. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, took action after the 6th to mitigate the risks of a further self-coup. He even [put out a memo on Jan 12th stating his actions.](http://archive.vn/YFzrL)^6 The people paying attention are [seeing the pattern for what it is.](http://archive.vn/CLaep)^7

## Americanisms

The US will be facing a constitutional crisis. We witnessed a practice violent coup on Jan 6. In a different century, when another angry charismatic man did this, he was barely punished at all and then returned 10 years later with a successful political coup. The political coup is going on right now, in the states of Georgia, Michigan, and Arizona. If the results of the primaries go a certain way, that movement will be re-energized. The coup has not failed yet. It has not stopped.

The US has already fulfilled the 14 points of a certain mode of government. That's old news. The ~~Sturmabteilung~~ Proud Boys (even in their neutered state), the Three Percenters, and the Oath Keepers have no shortage of [able-bodied, reactionary men.](http://archive.vn/0CoEw)^8 

The US is heavily divided through manufactured hatred. It is the tried and true method of divide-and-conquer used to kill a nation. The Germans did it to Namibia. The Dutch did it to South Africa. The Belgians did it to Rwanda. The Brits did it to Afghanistan. Reagan funded it in Yugoslavia. And now it's happening here.

In the scenario that things become kinetic, it is not going to end fast. Every enemy nation and their dog will be doing their damnest to keep the USA in conflict and de-stabilized for as long as possible. And every country that is not an open enemy will be doing their damnest to direct proxy battles and make sure that the power vacuum does not re-fill in the wrong way. There are thousands of reasons to be worried about the most powerful arsenal in human history. The US is far bigger than Germany or Yugoslavia. When it falls, the entire world will suffer.

## Frequently Awful Takes

> It won't happen because no one really wants it to.

The majority of people never want to go to war with their neighbors. Yet history has shown us that all it takes is an extreme vocal minority and a pathetic majority for these things to happen. And when it does happen, people who really don't want to choose are forced to choose. 

> Will it be a declared war or an undeclared war?

It is guerrilla warfare with a growing police state. No opposing forces are going to announce themselves to the public and arrange in neat battle positions.

> The police will protect us.

Historically, cops protect right-wing militias, join right-wing militias, and/or operate as their own ad hoc force in service to whatever charismatic figure promises ""law and order"". Police are people and they will protect their own families before they protect yours.

> My favorite governor/senator/millionaire will protect us.

They will be in their wealthy enclave with their private security forces or in their retreat in New Zealand, or Alaska, or with their money in Panama, Dubai, Monaco, Switzerland, or the Cayman Islands.

> We'll just run away to Canada/Mexico. 

American refugees from climate crises (just within the country) are already predicted to be tens of millions. If things turn kinetic, multiply that by 3. Illegal immigration is not suddenly okay when you try to do it. If your next plan is to hide out in the woods, that's the same plan as a million other people.

> The military will stop it immediately.

First, the military is an apolitical institution. The best scenario is that they don't do anything and remain an institution, ensuring their legitimacy. Second, [soldiers are not apolitical.](http://archive.vn/1CSrN)^9 If a Myanmar scenario occurs, they are likely to fracture when they have to start kicking in doors and bombing population centers that look like their own. That's an increase in militia forces. The upper brass has their own leanings as well. Third, it took about 25,000 soldiers to lock down a square mile of DC for a month after Jan 6. Do the math. The USA is too big for the military to effectively subdue a warring population.

> Civilians aren't armed enough to fight the military!

There are over 400 million guns in this country and a population of about 330 million. And military firearms, actual assault rifles, [go missing all the time.](http://archive.vn/OOZyi)^10 [So do the explosives.](http://archive.vn/7lZdf)^11

> Rednecks with guns can't stop drones!

Drones and tanks exist to perform specific tasks. They are excellent in the conventional format of war between nations. They're not so great against a guerrilla force of maybe 50 million+. A drone can't hold a street corner. Tanks are only as good as their supply chain of fuel. Like we saw in Afghanistan, and what Ethiopia is seeing against Tigray right now; even with all of your fancy weapon systems and national backers, if you are massively outnumbered in asymmetrical warfare then it is just a matter of time. Besides, while a drone pilot may operate out of a secure bunker in Hawaii, they have a family that lives in a city or town like everyone else. It's a dark thing to think about.

[Reddit's majority shareholder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit) is [Advance Publications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications). That company is owned by the Newhouse family, which is headed up by Donald Newhouse (pictured), who is worth $15.5 to 18.5 billion today, depending on whether you believe [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/profile/donald-newhouse/?sh=67d462bd1581) or [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/donald-e-newhouse/). Some of the early investors are listed in the Wikipedia article, and the later ones are listed on [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/reddit/company_financials).

The value of Reddit has skyrocketed during the last year. Revenue in Q2 was over [$100 million, a jump of 192%](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-secures-funding-to-continue-growth-plans/) from the year before. With their last round of funding, the company is now valued at at least $10 billion. At the beginning of the year, it was [valued at $6 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/reddits-valuation-doubles-to-6-billion-after-new-250-million-funding-round-.html).

Of course, Reddit's revenue and value come from advertising and selling user data. When the app is free, that means that you are the product. They need eyeballs on the app, and those eyeballs come almost entirely from content (like this post) and comments provided for free by unpaid users. The vast majority of the moderation work is also unpaid.

I think one could make an argument that getting out the message of r/antiwork is worth the trade, though some might disagree.  However, it seems to me that if you believe in the spirit of this subreddit, you should think about whether you want to post on subreddits that do not advance the agenda, like cooking, sports, and r/IdiotsInCars.

Frankly, I don't know what I am going to do. I don't use any other social media, but I have come to enjoy other communities on Reddit. I kind of feel like a sucker, though."

219,7,Reddit IPO Concerns,5,rj8qjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rj8qjl/reddit_ipo_concerns/,3,1639838140.0,I’m worried about the upcoming reddit IPO. Among other concerns this may be a thinly vailed method of suppressing antiwork and the momentum we’ve generated. How do we ensure the movement stays strong when reddit is trying to appease investors?
220,0,We need to lock the float before Reddit goes public.,1276,rk1ti6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/rk1ti6/we_need_to_lock_the_float_before_reddit_goes/,128,1639936285.0,"Title. 

I think if SHFs are able to buy reddit and can somehow affect censorship of the GME subs, the most impactful move they can make will be to shut down communication about DRS. I believe this is our biggest threat. 

Everyone knows to buy and hold. Fewer people know, or are willing, to DRS without a lot more information to make that choice easier. If SHFs are able to exert control over these subreddits in any way, you can bet your jacked tits that DRS posts and conversations will be much more restricted or potentially banned. 

Cutting out our primary way of discussing/helping each other DRS will be extremely detrimental to our DRS efforts and I think we would slow down dramatically at that point. 

Locking the float will take months, so will this IPO. We're currently ahead in the race, but we shouldn't risk anything. If DRS makes sense to you, there's no time to waste. Don't give them the opportunity to implement whatever evil shit they're cooking up right now. 

Who gives a fuck about anything on this sub besides DRS and a marketplace launch announcement at this point. DRS is within our control and it can fuck them but we don't have unlimited time. 

**Go DRS so fucking hard** (if you want). Ok thanks I love you bye."

[\\""Talk is cheap, it takes money to buy whiskey\\"" - Ryan Cohen](https://preview.redd.it/msihkstty4581.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6cb6c06d26b3498ac6f8f9620a5984f79461876)

Ryan Cohen was the CEO of Chewy, an e-commerce company specializing in pets, which he founded when he was just 25 years old. In 2017, he sold Chewy to PetSmart in a $3.3 billion deal to pursue other personal goals.

Then Ryan Cohen's investor side began to gain notoriety. After selling Chewy, he invested his money in only two companies Apple and Wells Fargo. In Apple, he even became the largest single investor with about 6 million shares.

By the end of 2020, Cohen had also become GameStop's largest single shareholder after acquiring 10% of GME's stock and subsequently increasing his stake to about 13%. These investments were made before the extraordinary price explosion in GameStop stock in late January 2021. Shortly thereafter in April, he was named charmain of the board of directors. (Excerpt from [TheStreet article](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/gme/gamestop-stock-understanding-the-ryan-cohen-factor))

Ryan Cohen articulates his investment approach as follows:

>It's very hard, at least for me, to find great ideas. When I find something I'm really convinced of, I go all-in. (Excerpt from [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo))

However, when Ryan Cohen started Chewy in 2011, he was rejected by most investors....

>**Friedman:** You were rejected by 100 different investors. What did you learn from that process? What made you keep going when you kept hearing no?  
>  
>**Cohen:** To me, every no sounded like they just didn't understand my vision. That was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those ""no's"" never made me doubt my strategy - quite the opposite. All the rejections motivated me, and they only spurred me on. (Excerpt from [Forbes interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=5f5a6f355840))

He goes on to say that

>**Cohen:** Most investors couldn't overcome two hurdles: direct competition with Amazon and the failure of [pets.com](https://pets.com/) during the dot-com bubble. However, I believed that focusing on the pets category, along with highly personalized customer service, gave Chewy unique competitive advantages. [Pets.com](https://pets.com/) was a good idea, but a decade too early and not big enough to cover its costs. Those two hurdles didn't deter me. I never thought of changing my business plan. A highly respected venture capitalist once told me that he would be more interested if we sold live pets over the Internet rather than pet supplies. Like most investors, he thought it would be suicidal to get in Amazon's way. (Excerpt from [Forbes interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=5f5a6f355840))

How he managed to slam Amazon with Chewy anyway he tells here....

>**Cohen:** I focused on bringing a human element to e-commerce. We offered 24/7 customer service in the U.S. and relied on small touches like handwritten vacation cards and personalized pet portraits. This allowed us to connect with our customers and retain them for the long term by aiming for a lifelong relationship, not just a single order. In 2018, 90% of our sales came from repeat customers. The secret to Chewy was the relationship with customers. I realized that one big thought along the way was likely to be misunderstood. I'm a contrarian by nature (\*probably not the most appropriate term in current covid times), and when I'm misunderstood, it's often an affirmation of what I'm doing. It wasn't until Chewy boxes started appearing on front doors across the country that the majority of investors recognized our formula. (Excerpt from [Forbes interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=5f5a6f355840))

It's worth noting that [GameStop has the largest digital magazine subscription in the world with ""Game Informer""](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Informer) and 55 million PowerUp members are registered with GameStop. Someone like Ryan Cohen can capitalize on this by focusing on customer service and customer experience. You can tell he has a strong penchant for customer loyalty.

# Who Ryan Cohen is working with and how he took over GameStop

The following information comes from the really great[researched report](https://gmedd.com/opinion/who-is-ryan-cohen-working-with/) from [GMEdd.com](https://gmedd.com/). I provide you the report only a little bit modified here...

[Since a deal was struck between RC Ventures and GameStop in January 2021](https://gmedd.com/news/rc-ventures-agreement-reached/), Ryan Cohen has been working almost exclusively behind the scenes to transform the company, though it's not known who he consults with on strategic moves. By looking at Cohen's past and the footprints he's left behind, [GMEdd.com](https://gmedd.com/) is able to make a few educated guesses.

**Chewy's other co-founder**

[Blake’s LinkedIn shows that he was Co-Founder & CTO of Chewy until April 2018, ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbday/)[just a month after it was announced Ryan Cohen would be stepping down as CEO](https://miamiherald.typepad.com/the-starting-gate/2018/03/change-at-the-top-co-founder-ryan-cohen-stepping-down-as-ceo-of-chewy.html). Both Blake and Ryan remained with the company for a year after a [$3B payday from PetSmart in 2017](https://www.vox.com/2017/4/18/15339208/petsmart-chewy-acquisition-price-3-35-billion).

[From past interviews with Ryan Cohen](https://www.inc.com/emily-canal/petsmart-acquires-chewy.html), we know the founders first met through an online Java chat room and shared similar visions for a groundbreaking e-commerce business before starting Chewy.com together, but insight on Blake remains limited beyond this.

In a [TechCrunch interview in 2019](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-on-its-fast-approaching-ipo-its-like-seeing-my-baby-graduate/?guccounter=1), Ryan Cohen was asked,

>Would you partner again with Michael on a different e-commerce business or maybe a venture outfit?

to which Ryan Cohen responded,

>We’re really close. It needs to be the right opportunity obviously, and we need to be picky. But I have no plans to sit in retirement, that’s for sure. I’m 33 and I’m competitive and I like consumer businesses and I like to win.

Ryan is arguably in the midst of his **biggest venture yet**

Although Chewy's headquarters are in Florida, [the company built a small team in Boston](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/01/17/chewy-com-bounds-into-boston/6yYT83yX031PrXaQ0zXwBJ/story.html), initially working in temporary space before leasing its own 20,000-square-foot space in 2017. Cohen says Boston was an attractive location to recruit tech talent:

>Boston is a fantastic tech and startup hub with dozens of universities. There's just a lot of talent here. We looked at all the major U.S. cities when we were planning this office, and Boston was the most competitive. (Excerpted from [Boston Globe article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/01/17/chewy-com-bounds-into-boston/6yYT83yX031PrXaQ0zXwBJ/story.html))

Blake Day, who served as CTO, led the Boston office. He gave an [interview to VentureFizz](https://venturefizz.com/stories/boston/engineering-spotlight-chewy) about the move to Boston, and you could tell he sounds a lot like Cohen:

Samantha Rassner served as Chewy’s Vice President of Software Development from September 2015 to February 2018. [In a LinkedIn blog post on her exit of the company, Samantha Rassner recounts Blake’s visionary speech](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-left-chewy-samantha-rassner/). Blake and Ryan sound one and the same here as well.

**Chewy's first investor**

[Larry Cheng, co-founder and managing partner of Volition Capital](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/members/larry-cheng/), was [the first major investor to back Chewy](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/portfolio/chewy/) after [the company was turned down numerous times by other firms.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/)

Larry’s investment through Volition was key to the growth and expansion of the company, and as a result, Larry and Ryan remain “fast friends.” While GameStop is a different story than Chewy,  it’s not crazy to think that Volition Capital and Larry Cheng have long been involved in mentoring the turnaround based on these facts alone.

https://preview.redd.it/70z29mc2z4581.png?width=462&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab9a270305ea0c185b67d006ad38cca09d3b394a

The timeline and Larry Cheng's seat on GameStop's board suggests **that Volition Capital and Larry Cheng are privy to Ryan's plans and have long been involved in supporting the turnaround**.

[Ryan Cohen filed his first 13D for GameStop via RC Ventures LLC on August 28, 2020, disclosing an initial 9% stake](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822844/000101359420000670/rc13d-082820.htm). This sparked waves, particularly within value investor circles, as many pondered the E-commerce guru’s investment motives.

What few realize is that Cohen didn’t initially invest in August 2020, but much earlier in April 2019. This can be deduced from the [initial 13D](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822844/000101359420000670/rc13d-082820.htm), through share counts and averages based on implied price. [Rod Alzmann of GMEdd.com](https://gmedd.com/rod) states that when he inquired with GameStop last year, investor relations confirmed that Cohen had held $GME since April 2019.

Just one week after Ryan’s public disclosure, on September 4th, 2020, Volition Capital published an insight piece titled[ *Gaming as a Service and Why it Matters,*](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/gaming-as-a-service-and-why-it-matters/) authored by one of the firm’s associates, Claude de Jocas. This also appears to be the [first piece of gaming related research the firm has released.](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/gaming-as-a-service-and-why-it-matters/)

Over the next few weeks, [Ryan added to his position twice more until reaching a 9.98% stake, disclosed September 21](https://sec.report/Document/0001013594-20-000699/). Weeks later, on October 9, Volition released a video where Claude de Jocas discusses the[ future of internet gaming and its growth potential.](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/video-the-future-of-internet-gaming-with-claude-de-jocas/)

Skip ahead just one month, and on November 17, Ryan filed an amendment to his 13D [with an attached letter to the GameStop board urging the company to share a credible plan for seizing opportunities in the rapidly growing gaming sector.](https://gmedd.com/rc/ryan-cohen-urges-strategic-review-in-letter-to-the-board/)

**PR Blitz**

Ryan Cohen was far from being a household name in August of 2020 when he filed his initial stake in GameStop, so many investors started researching him to get a feel for what his plan was.[ At the time, Ryan had established a website, ryan-cohen.com, that embedded various media appearances and formal interviews the Chewy co-founder had given, but it has since been shut down in December of 2020.](https://web.archive.org/web/20201214000353/https://ryan-cohen.com/)

Had the website done its job? 

https://preview.redd.it/1e6tnz3fz4581.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2358e9f86124408e7a0d9ca53689dedac2e71bc

[Retail investing icon Roaring Kitty first stumbles upon Ryan Cohen’s rudimentary homepage during an August 28th, 2020 livestream.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Af9T8TU2OM?t=1950) At the time, the deep value investor was merely trying to learn more about the Chewy founder. Most of the content was posted on the site between mid-2019, around Chewy’s IPO and Cohen’s initial GameStop investment, and mid-2020.

Investors could speculate that this may have been [a coordinated PR blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_campaign) campaign [before revealing a large stake in a public company](https://gmedd.com/rc), one that he had already been discreetly acquiring.

Each interview Cohen conducted provided valuable insight into his business strategy, and much of how he described Chewy’s story and his vision could also be applied to GameStop. Was this intentional? [In one September 2019 post on Medium, when asked about what’s next, Ryan hinted at something being on the horizon](https://medium.com/authority-magazine/chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-we-put-together-a-team-that-was-obsessed-with-delighting-our-customers-e8cacbd0477b).

>I\`m only 34, so i certainly haven\`t peaked as an entrepreneur yet. Stay tuned.

Okay, where were we? [Ryan Cohen started buying into GameStop in April of 2019, with a disclosure following increased holdings in August 2020.](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-gme-gamestop-rc-ventures-llc-sc-13d-2020-august-28-18503) It’s unknown as to when he made the decision and how much time was spent beforehand figuring out activist investor logistics coinciding with a PR blitz, **but it is reasonable to assume he was strategically building public-facing credibility for himself before revealing his high-stakes investment**.

Fast forward to 2021, [Ryan Cohen now owns 12.9% of GameStop](https://gmedd.com/rc/ryan-cohen-increases-stake/), joins the board, an extraordinary price explosion in late January generated national coverage of GameStop, prompting a series of [congressional hearings](https://gmedd.com/regulatory/gamestop-hearing-scheduled/), and suddenly everyone knows about [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/).

Amid all of this attention, the company remains quiet but starts undergoing rapid transformation, which was initially visible from the Investor Relations page, but now only seen through [activity on LinkedIn](https://gmedd.com/opinion/gamestop-poaches-talent-from-the-best/) — there have been over 30 new hires in tech and E-commerce positions starting in February, [just a month after Cohen joined the GameStop board.](https://gmedd.com/news/rc-ventures-agreement-reached/)

**Strategic Advisory**

[On March 2nd, 2021, Volition Capital launched a new Strategic Advisory Board](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/volition-capital-launches-strategic-advisory-board-underscores-commitment-to-accelerate-portfolio-company-success/) that, “will provide focused guidance to the firm and its portfolio companies regarding strategic direction, investments, executive hiring and development, due-diligence, network and operational strategy, among other areas.” Volition states that the firm had been working on assembling this board for almost a year.

So a venture firm launched a strategic advisory board. Who cares?

[Wait, that name is familiar…](https://www.volitioncapital.com/strategic-advisory-board/#blake-day)

As of March 2021, Blake is now at the helm of Volition’s Strategic Advisory Board. Blake has l**argely laid low since his Chewy departure** and [still lives in Fort Lauderdale](https://gmedd.com/transformation/gamestop-hints-at-new-florida-office/) according to his Volition Capital bio.

Volition’s second listed Strategic Advisory Board Member is [Raul Fernandez, ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raul-fernandez-2877404)who serves as[ Vice Chairman and Owner of Monumental Sports & Entertainment](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raul-fernandez-2877404), which is a private partnership of Washington DC’s major sports franchises including eSports teams.

Early GameStop investors will recognize Raul’s name, because they will have seen it before as well.

GameStop claims that [Raul Fernandez was appointed to the board](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-raul-fernandez-and-lizabeth-dunn-board)  under an agreement with *Hestia Capital Partners, L.P.* (“Hestia Capital”) and *Permit Capital Enterprise Fund, L.P.*  (“Permit Capital”), lead by currently outgoing GameStop director and atypical shareholder activist [Kurt Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurt-wolf-b0a412b).

Hestia Capital and Permit Capital, together with their affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 1.3% of GameStop at this point, and Kurt Wolf, as their Managing Partner, had [just sent a letter to GameStop’s board calling for a corporate refresh.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hestia-capital-and-permit-capital-send-letter-to-gamestop-gme-board-of-directors-calling-for-a-refreshed-board-and-stock-tender-offer-of-up-to-700-million-300812140.html)

Wolf had been advocating for GameStop’s board to [adapt to the times and transform from an underperforming retailer into a forward-thinking company that emphasized long-term growth](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hestia-capital-and-permit-capital-send-letter-to-gamestop-gme-board-of-directors-calling-for-a-refreshed-board-and-stock-tender-offer-of-up-to-700-million-300812140.html).

While the GameStop board claimed they began to cooperate with Hestia/Permit in April of 2019, [Ryan Cohen](http://twitter.com/ryancohen) began purchasing his initial position in the gaming retailer.

Fernandez still currently serves on GameStop’s board, and [filings reveal he will be stepping down at the Annual General Meeting on June 9th, ](https://gmedd.com/news/rc-ventures-on-pace-to-control-gamestop-board/)as Ryan Cohen takes the reigns as incoming Chairman of the Board. 

# GameStop's transformation to a technology company

A lot has happened in the nearly 10 months so far since Ryan Cohen was appointed to GameStop's board in February 2021, and it's clear that the transformation is in full swing:

* [Total of 322 new hires since February](https://gmedd.com/report-model/) for e-commerce, UI, UX, blockchain, operations and supply chain, including 200+ senior management hires coming from leading tech companies. Most of the new hires are from Chewy, Amazon, and Zulily. (It's worth noting that many of the new hires are talking about a one-time opportunity, and even the senior director of Apple Care, who worked there for 10-years, is moving to GameStop. Management also heavily promotes just about everything on LinkedIn)

# Conclusion

You can see that RC really believes in what he is doing. It's a mentality like this why some people say ""invest in the man, not the company"". And I think that saying fits. I have faith in Ryan Cohen! This guy fucks! Similarly with someone like Elon Musk. I don't want to put anyone on a pedestal, but a lot of investors put a lot of blind faith in him because they believe in his vision. It's great when you can combine a great company with a visionary at the helm. That's the cherry on top of a solid investment.

Here's some more fundamental analysis on this....

* ""GameStop is neither an ordinary stock nor a failing retail chain, as Wall Street previously thought."" [Value Analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gamestop-ordinary-stock-nor-failing-brick-and-mortar-retail-michal/?trackingId=ZpbD7gBYSAuidJ3HF2LEeg%3D%3D) by Michal Gregersen (Aspiring portfolio manager & equity trader)

Furthermore, [since June 23, 2021, not a single insider with more information than anyone else has sold their shares](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1326380.htm). And that was just one person selling since January.

GameStop is the world's largest retailer of video games. With Ryan Cohen as its new chairman and a new, technology-focused board, the company now has unified leadership dedicated to two long-term goals: **""delighting customers and creating value for shareholders.""** 2021 was a watershed year for GameStop, with a strengthened and consolidated financial position ([$1.4 billion cash on hand in Q3](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-financial-results-q3-2021)) and rapidly increasing net sales ([29% growth in Q3](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-financial-results-q3-2021)), the transformation is also well underway.

In addition, GameStop has made a **radical strategic shift**, **expanding its business model** to compete and thrive in the age of mobile gaming and digital downloads, and reinvented itself as a major e-commerce player. Gamestop already has **4,816 stores in 14 countries and over 55 million PowerUp members**. As it continues to develop its e-commerce business and build a mass-market NFT marketplace, the long-term potential of this company is truly great.

And so regardless of the hotly debated MOASS theory, GameStop is an undervalued stock for me to invest in long-term. And I have my shares registered directly in my name (DRS) with Computershare because I hate synthetic/naked shares.

bis zu meinem 52. Lebensjahr (ja, es gibt echt so alte Leute hier) hatte ich weder Geld zum Investieren an der Börse, noch wäre ich bereit gewesen, meine sauerverdienten Spargroschen wie ein Grosskapitalist vermehren zu wollen. 

Aktien? Teufelszeug! Ausbeutung! Leistungsloses Einkommen! Pfui Deibel. 🤮

Das einzige, in das ich als Alleinerziehende einen Arsch voll Geld investiert habe, das war die Ausbildung meiner beiden Mädels. Dafür haben sie mir einen Platz in einem schicken Altersheim mit See- oder Flussblick versprochen, nebst knackigem Personal-Pfleger. 👩‍🦼🕺🏻Ein guter Deal, wie ich finde. 

Natürlich ist mir klar, dass das ein hochriskantes Geschäft ist, wer weiss, ob sich die Plagen dereinst an das Geschäft erinnern werden. Vielleicht werde ich ja dement und ich vergesse am Ende selbst, dass ich doch eigentlich auf Kosten meiner Kinder meinen Lebensabend in der Luxusdependance mit Hummer und Champagner verbringen sollte, während ich in Wirklichkeit in einem Stift für alte Damen lande, wo ich mich mich über Haferschleimsuppe und Klatschkreise bei Schlagermusik jubeln sähe  - obwohl ich doch schon mein ganzes Leben lang Metal-Fan bin. 

Just also, als ich beginne, mir über Rente usw. Gedanken zu machen, stolpere ich über Berichte zur verbotenen Aktie. 

Was ich da lese, erfreut mein Herz, das bei mir selbst dann links schlagen würde, wenn es rechts sässe. 

Eine Horde Kleinanleger zockte demnach die Finanzhaie ab, schlägt das System mit seinen Waffen. Jaja, die Zeitungen schreiben viel, wenn der Tag lang ist, vor allem Mist. Aber systemkritische Revolution und gleichzeitig auf Kosten der Reichen auch reich werden, ha!, die Idee gefiel mir, auch wenn sie zu schön klang, um von mir tatsächlich geglaubt zu werden. 

Vielmehr wurde mir einfach klar, dass ich etwas für meine Altersvorsorge tun musste und dass es an der Zeit wäre, den Tatsachen ins Auge zu sehen: In meinem Alter wird man nicht mehr von Millionären geheiratet, Lotto spielen wird auch nix bringen, es bleibt nur der Kapitalismus. 

Flugs eröffnete ich ein Depot in der Handelsrepublik und verlor erst mal, ganz so, wie es sich gehört, reichlich Geld mit Aktien, weil ich natürlich alle Anfängerfehler mitnahm, die man machen konnte. 
Zu hoch rein, Panikverkäufe, die ganze Klaviatur des Versagens. 

Ehrlich gesagt, da packte mich die Wut auf meine eigene Dämlichkeit und ich mich selbst bei der Ehre. 

Ich erinnerte mich an die Artikel über die Kleinanlegerrevolution, da stand irgendwas von so einer Art Insider-Forum namens „Reddit“. Dazu muss man wissen: Ich bin weder bei Insta, auch nicht bei Facebook und wenn ich TikTok höre, dann denke ich, es klopft jemand an die Tür. Ich erstellte mir dennoch einen Account und fand mich als u/silvaggia unter anderem bei r/finanzen wieder. Du liebe Güte,  das war nicht meine Welt. Ich wollte ganz sicher nicht trockene Spaghetti futtern, um drei Tage früher in Rente gehen zu dürfen. 

So führte mich der Weg schnurstraks in die Mauerstrasse. 

Nachdem ich mich bei der Umfrage, in der wir gemeinsam und vor allem höchst freiwillig u/ifaqyurmama zum beliebtesten Mod kürten, als wohl älteste Bewohnerin der Mauerstrasse geoutet hatte, wurde mir das Flair „MSW-Omi“  verliehen. Und ich kann sagen, ich trug es mit Stolz! 

Ich hebelte, was das Zeug hielt, verlor, gewann - wie es sich für eine ordentliche Mauerstrassenwettlerin gehört. Ich freute mich über den regen Austausch im Daily, über lustige Maimas und vor allem darüber: Niemand nahm scheinbar Anstoss daran, dass ich tatsächlich noch viel älter als der Ritter war. 

Bis zu dem Tag, an dem in einem Daily jemand die Frage stellte, wer wohl der dümmste User hier im Unter sei. Neugierig, wie alte Frauen halt so sind, klickte ich auf die Verlinkung - und landete auf meinem eigenen Profil. 

Schockstarre. 😱Ich hatte mich sauwohl hier gefühlt. Dass ich, die in ihrer analogen Welt als durchaus belesen und halbwegs intelligent gilt, auf die junge Generation ganz offensichtlich - siehe Verlinkung - dumm wirkte, das hatte mich tatsächlich getroffen. Und das fanden wohl auch andere, der Beitrag wurde reichlich gelikt. Dumme alte Gans, scholt ich mich, das kommt davon, wenn man einfach nicht einsehen mag, dass man alt und peinlich wird. Ich weinte ein paar Tränen in mein Kopfkissen und löschte meinen Account. Ende 1. Akt.

2. Akt
Nach einiger Zeit in der ich nur heimlich hier rumluscherte, entschloss ich mich, mich neu anzumelden. Gesagt, getan. Just zu dieser Zeit ergab es sich, das wieder die Frage nach dem dümmsten User gestellt wurde. Da ich das ja nicht mehr sein konnte, mein alter Account war ja gelöscht, klickte ich extrem gespannt auf die Verlinkung, um zu schauen, wer denn nun meine Nachfolge angetreten habe. 

Und ich landete, Ihr werdet es ahnen, wieder auf meinem Profil. 

Es dauerte einen Moment, bis ich begriff: Der Link führte ausnahmslos jeden auf das jeweils eigene Profil. 😵‍💫🤯🙈

Ja, da war er, der ultimative Beweis: Ich war wirklich mit Abstand der dümmste User bzw die dümmste Userin dieses Unters. 

😹😹😹😹😹😹😹

Ich will nun diese Feststellung dazu nutzen, all jenen, die hier in der letzten Zeit Verluste gemacht und viel Geld verloren haben, sagen: Schaut her: Egal wie dumm Ihr Euch deswegen fühlt, verliert nicht den Mut. Wenn die dümmste Userin des Unters es schafft, bummelig 50% 

https://imgur.com/a/SmN0G4f

in knapp einem Jahr zu machen, dann schafft Ihr das auch. 

Fragt mich bitte nicht nach meiner Stategie. Ich hab‘ keine. Wäre ich weniger dumm gewesen, dann könnten da auch 100% stehen, denn ich habe tatsächlich auch viel Geld verloren mit Puts und Calls auf Biontech und auf den Nasdaq oder zB, weil ich so doof war, günstig gekaufte Aktien aus dem Bereich Psychedelic Drugs, auf den ich z. B. langfristig wirklich grosse Hoffnung setze, über den IPO hinaus zu halten, statt die fetten Gewinne mitzunehmen und später wieder einzusteigen.

Aus jedem Fehltrade habe ich allerdings gelernt und letztlich hat sich das ausgezahlt - >50% EOY. Ich habe Ende letzter Woche weitgehend ausgecasht und warte jetzt mit Euch auf den Weltuntergang. Je nachdem, was der Opa von drüben postuliert, steige ich langsam wieder ein. 

Dass ich doch noch ganz gut performt habe, verdanke ich auch Euch, liebe Nachbarn und Nachbarinnen hier aus der Mauerstrasse, Eurem Wissen, ja, auch Euren Fehlern. Und das weiss ich zu schätzen. Ihr seid eine tolle Truppe! Deshalb möchte ich auch hier um Entschuldigung bitten, geglaubt zu haben, ich sei hier altersbedingt nicht gelitten. Das war wirklich saudummst. 

Und wenn es nicht ganz so unverschämt wirkt, dann hätte ich gerne mein Flair als MSW-Omi zurück, u/ifaqyurmama. 

Danke vorab, auch im Namen meiner Eltern. 🙏

We all know what happened after once mighty Tumblr banned adult content - their user base evaporated by almost 50% practically overnight and they are no longer a household name. Even bringing back limited amounts of adult content didn’t help them. 

If Reddit pulls the same stunt, how long so you think that it will take their stock to tumble and what way would be the best way to capitalize on it?

Reddit was invented by young libertarian types but has slowly acquiesced to demands of the government and special interest groups. There is a long line of failed social media sires before Reddit came on the scene and Reddit’s technology could be easily replicated. 

I only see corporate board types and shareholders destroying the formula that makes Reddit special.

2013  Yahoo bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion

Why?

Tumblr went down the path of banning explicit content, smut, bascially everything that was driving user growth. NSFW for everything bad, is a huge catalyst for users, activity and every single metric that matters.

Look at the fear that happened when Onlyfans decided they aren't a porn/sexworker place and wanted to go in another direction? Massive backlash and now they may not be able to go public.

Reddit has a huge base of NSFW activity, subreddits that discuss things that wouldn't fly anywhere else. While the CEO has said previously they aren't willing to ban porn and other objectionable content. That was before reddit goes public and suddenly becomes worth suing.

Imagine someone posts some revenge porn, or copy righted material, or someone follows DD and loses all their life savings investing in Silver derivatives. Sure reddit can say they police but that argument isn't helping instagram, facebook, pornhub. 

Reddit was too small to sue before. If reddit goes public I guarantee they will be worth suing there's going to be a ton of crack downs.

236,11,Reddit IPO Valuation,52,rkra3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rkra3v/reddit_ipo_valuation/,48,1640018158.0,"As you all know, Reddit has begun its process to file for an IPO. As we all use the platform and are most likely going to trade it, one way or the other, I see it prudent to open source this back of the napkin valuation to see what you autists think. 

**The Metrics**

Reddit, like all of the other social media platforms, primarily generates its revenue from ads. Thus, the KPIs we want to look at here are the MAUs and the average visit duration. Since, theoretically, the money from advertisers is going to flow to the company that has the most people coming to the platform and staying for the most amount of time. 

\*\*Since Snapchat doesn't give the MAU data, only the DAU, I just took the DAU and multiplied it by 2 lol. 

\*\*For any data that was missing, I normalized it by utilizing the respective company's MAU CAGR. 

MAU CAGR:

[I thought only moms used Pinterest](https://preview.redd.it/ba1o597f2q681.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=124bc03ae65ef95207544d62029d7ff7b0756a90)

MAU:

[Normalized by not including Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/szr9xkhsrp681.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=4258944ef27b8736c9c3db14798c2844c2150074)

Average Visit Duration:

[SNAP is assumed at 30 minutes](https://preview.redd.it/g7571g5wsp681.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9727504d3c00a71b60c0f12ee9ec880f84db9706)

Now, if we look at the 2026 MAUs, by using their MAU CAGR, and multiple the current average visit duration of each platform, we get the 2026 monthly average viewership. This metric is what ad sellers would most likely want to see.

2026 Monthly Average Viewership:

[In Minutes](https://preview.redd.it/ogxwigrovp681.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f4e0516518d532445067faec4ca43d4c9b62d38)

Here, we see Facebook as the clear platform winner, however, Reddit has continued to grow and has usurped Snapchat and Pinterest to become the #2 platform in monthly viewership. 

Now, with this \*information\* taken into consideration, the market is currently pricing these platforms at the following valuations:

**FB**: 903B

**TWTR**: 34B

**SNAP**: 72B

**PINS**: 23B

And I assign a value multiple comparing each platform's 2026 av. monthly viewership to Reddit's and then use that multiple to find the comparative market cap of Reddit. 

**FB**: -2.09 => 432B

**TWTR**: 1.86 => 63B

**SNAP**: 1.07 => 76B

**PINS**: 1.52 => 35B

Now, we have a range of Reddit comp valuations that I take the median of and slap a 40% safety of margin to because I know I am wrong. This returns a market valuation for Reddit of 50B. If we exclude Facebook from the list, we get a median return of 45B. For some reason, though, I think this is far too much and the likely range of valuation would be closer to 30B-45B.

All in all, Reddit is currently priced at $10B via its last series funding round. As we close in on the IPO date I suspect Reddit will begin to rapidly gain in valuation. Maybe we'll see it trade up to or even more than 45B. Who knows? I certainly do not have a clue. But as more info comes out I would like to see how off this valuation is. 

This sub has really shit on Reddit's IPO because you all think it'll follow with heavy censorship and/or monetization. If Reddit fucks with anything in that way it essentially destroys its platform. -that's all I'll say on that."

I’ve been thinking a lot about the Reddit IPO - a few years ago I heard Shaq say that he doesn’t invest in companies he believes in, he invests in companies he USES…and that philosophy has worked out really well for him (especially his big Google purchase). 

With that shared, I’m thinking of making a big investment in Reddit. I think Reddit has the ability to go ALL the way. 

However, as a MEMBER and serious considering INVESTOR - here are my concerns (also happy to hear everyone else’s thoughts and concerns on this topic):

- When Reddit becomes an IPO is it subject to more oversight? One of the things that I love about Reddit is it’s open market style - from Wall Street Bets convos, to OnlyFans & prostitution channels, info on replica gear, and honest on anything we can imagine. Will that be lost? How might censorship play a role in Reddit becoming an IPO? Could that lead to the death of Reddit from a user perspective? Might users be required to reveal more of their private information? Will our data and conversations be sold or used against us? 

These are big picture concerns for me. If Reddit is able to survive as it does in this current moment, I think it has the opportunity to be HUGE and worth a Wall Streets Bets rally. 

What’s everyone else’s thoughts on this?"

**Funny thing is that I was unware of this development when I was writing.**

**That is big news but I suggest reading forward to see $ABCL value beyond Covid.**

*I also shorted the personal views of life part.No time for that.*

So, as this new guy arround Omicy is doing some more damage, the Covid investing theme has been revamped like an old pleasure worker, getting some charm again.

**We all know the trick: get a winner that might make some nice and fa(s)t gains if it hits gold BUT in the same time to make sure that with out this particular opportunity, it has a bigger value than the one assesed by the market.**

Now many things happened in 2020 also in tech, energy, etc but biotech was hot on pandemic and to elimnate the need to research some other field, I only focused on biotechs.

1. So I browsed and I shuffled eliminating first the ones that are already flying high on Covid fears. Easy money are already made there. No time for that.
2. Then I eliminated the stocks that had debt, like 0 ZERO debt. The rate hike is in the cards and will make  refinancing or repaying that debt harder. No time for that.
3. Further I eliminated (againt my feelings) all the de-spacs. That trend has its own highs and downs and is  you know... keep it simple. Small caps, easy to manipulate stocks - dumped as well.

**And then I started to dig deep in the pipelines of the few left on the table. Some pretty good names there, a lot to read but  $ABCL Abcellera stood right there.**

To be honest I owned some already (bc of Peter Thiel) but my selection was ownership blind. Just going for the target.

Very short backgroudn story - Abcellera become worldwide famous in 2020 as they were the first company on the planet to get EUA for their antibody treatment. After the IPO ABCL surged as high as 70s and now stands at $13.5. They made some nice hundres of millions until now from that antibody but got crushed when vaccines rolled out, got facny again on variant D as their antibody works great on that and it seems they have a new antibody that can kill Omicron too. (see the update in the top of the page). 

**But**, **You know why $ABCL is great?**

**ABCL pipeline has 150 programs and 131 are royalty based. All those 131 programs have nothing to do with Covid. Nothing.**

**What that means is that from any of this 131 programs they stand to win some 5% (source- management)  of the sales.**

**How much is that?**

I googled it - laisy bastard sometimes and I actualy found a guy (but reddit won't let me place a link here) that actually did that math for me:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2lskkywl6y581.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ee4fb675f7c1cbc89f0986419d0d45f77be9e3

They have some 700M cash in hand right now and stand to earn some more this quarter as they deliver more antbody and they didn't shown any tendency o dillute stock holders (I'll dig deep in to that later).

Now, 25% success rate seemed too high for my taste (you know lowest risk, right?)

ABCL has a 25+% success rate but the industry average is 15%. I wanted to make the math for an industry average.

This time is much easier: 15 out of 25 is something like 60%. 60% out of 41$ is 24$.

**Even if ABCL would be an average biotech - with this number of programs, the real value of $ABCL would be 24$. Right now if not 1$ would be earned from their covid antibody. Also NO growth rate has been factored in. Like they would not sign another customer in the next decade.**

But, wait (if you're not bored already) and let's seee just how average is ABCL. Who knows, maybe they are under average or not.

**In short about ABCL**

ABCL owns a global database of different antibodies, from humans and lot of species. On top of that full stakc they use AI to identify the best candidate that can kills a bacteria, virus or cancer and that candidate gets cloned, mutiplied and delivered to the pacient.

Spunds like a great idea but are they really good at doing that? Let's see.

**Who's vetting for ABCL**

I am not that smart to judge on scientifical merrits, but I know who's hat smart - big pharma. Seeing who's working with them and actually pays them, can give a clue on how serious are they.

Here is the short list (the ones that I recognized) of partners of ABCL that are also paying for their platform/research right now. Also this guys are responsible for that 131 programs with royalties:

EliLily\*, Sanofi, GSK\*, Novartis, Bill&Melinda Gates, Gilead, Pfizer, Kodiak, Merck, Regeneron\* and very recently Moderna. It is hard to name a big pharma that is not there.

\*Also you might notice among the biotechs using their platform are all the Covid antibody competition.

Each one of those are ordering more programs and many others are joining them quarter by quarter.

Here is the growth rate focusing on programs ony:

***Q2*** ***Total programs under contract of 138, up 82% from Q2 2020***

***Q3 2021- Total programs under contract of 155 adding 17 new programs.***

[***https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/abcellera-biologics-inc-abcl-q3-2021-earnings-call/***](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/abcellera-biologics-inc-abcl-q3-2021-earnings-call/)

Who else is backing them? O**h, the Canadian Goverment gave them already some 176M.** Some 50M were for the Covid treatment development but 125M was given to build a nice cool factory.

They are building right now a GMP protein biologic manufacturing area and the building will feature laboratory, offices and warehouse space.

[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/projects/abcellera-biologics-vancouver-facility/](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/projects/abcellera-biologics-vancouver-facility/)

And my favorite early investor (innitial backer)  and member of the board of Abcellera - **Peter Thiel (PLTR, LAZR, ASANA).**

But, hey, if you don;t know who's Peter Thiel ... this is not the place to learn but you should really find time and google it.

**Conclusion**

I already got tired of writing and you got bored with my story.

**Here is the deal :**

* **ABCL IPO price was 20$ (with only some 80 programs and factory paid by Canadian goverment),**
* **ABCL target price (6 analysts median) is 46$**
* **ABCL in my conservative, NO COVID valuation, sets the price at 24$.**
* **Right now you can buy it with 13.5.**

Now, if Covid will stay arround they will make a lot more money like really a lot.

They also have under clinical test a new antibody LY-CoV1404 or Bebtelovimab. As of September 2021 NIH was saying that it can kill ALL Covid variants. IT seems that atacks that protein that don't mutate.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8109210/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8109210/)

Who knows? Untill FDA says otherwise, we need to see this.

Right now the risks on the table are like this:

Scenario 1: If ABCL puts on the table a proven Omicron killer, the stock will rally and we will never see it at 13.5 again.

Scenario 2: If ABCL gets more contracts with the same or other big guys, or if they publish some positive data from any of those 131 programs, it will rally as their business model will get more and more visibility. Chance are that maybe you can get it again at this price or not.

Scenario 3: If ABCL stops selling Covid antobodies and stop signing new contracts, it will keep develop new drugs and slowlly rise to 24$

Scenario 4: IF ABCL suddenly stops delivering results, gets contracts cancelled and they prove to be a ponzi scheme - we all loose our money and will be proved stupid along Peter Thiel, all the Canadian Gov. (not sure there:) Bill Gates, Pfizer, Sanofi, Gilead, GSK and you get the idea :D.

While I also think that Reddit is not a ""goldmine"" in an of itself this is not where the value comes from. Institutions typically buy news and media stocks like crazy. Institutional ownership of the New York times (NYT) for instance is currently above 93% which is ""typical"" for news companies.

Is this because the NYT or news companies in general are so profitable? Well, while the NYT made a profit of 65.1 million in the third quarter 2021, an increase of 15% from the same quarter one year ago, I do not think that this is the actual reason. Rather the true value comes from elsewhere. If you own it you can decide which articles are published, which topics are covered and have influence on the narrative. I.e. owning these companies allows you to push out news that positively affect stocks you are long on and negatively affect stocks you shorted. This is were their actual value for institutions comes from.

Or do you think stuff like this happens on coincidence?

Anyways, I think the same is true for Reddit. They already do this to some extent but owning the actual company will help to ""tighten"" their grip.

242,17,"Let's talk about ROKU, kids.",0,ryejsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ryejsh/lets_talk_about_roku_kids/,145,1641581007.0,"## **Introduction**

 I have been pumping ROKU stock for some time. The last time I wrote up some bullish DD was August 2019. The most extensive DD I wrote was Aug 2018 when it was trading at $60/share (I'll link it below). The reasons I like the stock then (very fast growth in users + ARPU) as well as the long-term durability of a business that comes attached to a several hundred dollar device (heavy, not something you move in a whim) still apply. The recent drops make me more bullish on the company than I have ever been. 

## **The Company**

ROKU is a profitable, fast-growing advertising technology company (like Facebook, Twitter, or Google) that sells television devices as well as software that runs on those devices. Founded in 2002, it is even older than Facebook and Twitter, but didn't IPO until 2017. 

The profitability growth experienced by ROKU since its IPO has been phenomenal -- the vast majority of the stock's performance comes from the performance in its financials, rather than to multiple expansion. ROKU IPO-d at 10x gross profit and now trades at about 20x gross profit -- while gross profit increasing about 7x over the same timeframe. Last quarter, ROKU clocked a 70% YoY increase in gross profit -- the flywheel is still moving at an incalculable rate.

Sales growth has been more modest, remaining in the 50%-60% range but gross profit growth is more reflective of the strength of the business, as ROKU's revenue lumps together one minimally unprofitable + moderate growth business (sales of players) with a highly profitable + fast growing one (sales of targeted ads + other platform fees). 

It's surprising to consider that ROKU is still growing its top line about as quickly as when it IPO-d, but mathematically, this is because small declines in platform growth rate have been offset by the business as a whole increasingly reflecting this faster growing segment. As the platform business is now around 75%-80% of the business, future revenue growth will increasingly reflect platform growth, not player growth. Hence, this shift in mix toward the faster-growing business should continue to act as a tailwind for the company's relative financial performance, even as the growth from this business itself slows over time.

To make a long story short, ROKU's top-line growth is not likely to slow down in the coming years, as both this minor tailwind and minor headwind should be anticipated to roughly offset one another for years to come. Consistent growth at 50%+ for any non-negligible amount of time leads to big numbers, quick.

## **Future Performance**

ROKU continues to grow extremely quickly, and the stock should continue to benefit from increased revenues & profits, as well as from multiple expansion.

## **10- Year Risk**

Warren Buffett likes to ask whether a company in 10 years might have revenues and profits that are not substantially increased from where they are today. In ROKU's case, the risk of this outcome is essentially zero -- even if users stopped growing tomorrow and never resumed, ARPU growth alone could carry the business. As a profitable company, there is no risk to ROKU the company should the capital markets dry up in a big way (though this would of course hurt the stock).

## **Competitive Landscape**

ROKU reports having the #1 market share in the US & Canada, as well as growing market share in its new international markets -- Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom & France Expansion to new geographies in Europe & Lat/Am is on the immediate horizon. 

ROKU describes its international strategy as ""doing what worked in the US, but in other countries."" Indeed, this does seem to be working.

## **The Setup**

Back in 2020, ROKU came to be seen as a ""pandemic stock"" -- a company that benefited greatly from one-time factors experienced during the corona pandemic. So for 2021, the comps were tough, and the stock took a hit. The result is a severe market overreaction -- ROKU grew like a weed prior to the pandemic, it grew like a weed during the pandemic, and, it will grow like a weed after the pandemic. The coronavirus affected annual growth rates and profits in a big way, but it did not affect the intrinsic value in a similar way.

The stock is more than 50% off from its highs, even lower than it traded pre-pandemic, while being the strongest company that it has ever been with no signs of stopping. 

**PT: $4,200**

* developers and hackers are not able to get the (private) user data. It is at least extremely difficult.
* It is impossible for a hacker to manipulate contributions afterwards
* It is impossible for a person (hacker) to exclude or disenfranchise a user. community has that under its control. (remember why we already have two sub migrations behind us?)

TA;DR

The law firm he worked at represent literally every shit bank there is and some funds, they were involved in sketchy parts of Dodd-Frank allowing foreign entities to not report, they assist banks and funds in predatory lending/ vulture investing,  they were involved in Enron, Lehman Brothers, represent the Rockefellers, Citadel owned 10% of ETrade and forced a sell and they showed up to represent Goldman Sachs,  bankrupted a mining company in California that does rare minerals MCPIQ with Oaktree, killed a cable competitor with HSBC in 2004 and have some super questionable practices.


He goes to the SEC and starts cock blocking regulation *on shit they influenced when it was made.* [As seen recently.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/secs-partisan-divide-on-display-as-republican-commissioners-object-to-gensler-plan-to-overturn-trump-era-rules-11623701634) 

> “Perhaps the absence of these rules is attributable to the regrettable decision to spend our scarce resources to undo a number of rules the Commission just adopted.”

> Indeed, the agenda contains several proposals to revise rules adopted less than a year ago, including rules reigning in companies that provide advice on how institutional shareholders should vote on shareholder proposals, a rule mandated by the Dodd-Frank legislation that resource-extraction firms disclose payments made to foreign governments in countries where they operate and a rule that limited payments to whistleblowers that alert the SEC of wrongdoing at private companies.

> The two complained that revisiting recently adopted rules creates uncertainty for the private sector around how long a controversial rule will remain on the books, which they said will stifle economic activity.

&nbsp;

The Dodd-Frank thing, they are protecting these people from reporting what they are doing. 

> Many such entities 
enter into interest-rate, currency and credit default swaps to manage their currency reserves and 
domestic mortgage and related securities portfolios. Agencies potentially affected include 
central banks, treasury ministries, export agencies and housing finance authorities. The volume 
of such transactions is substantial and may well exceed the levels proposed in the Commissions' 
definition of ""major swap participant.""

MSM, these brokers, literally doing everything in their power to push FUD onto GameStop and crush any momentum.  It is no accident this headline stayed on top all day.

*7 Potential IPOs in 2022:  Discord, OpenSea...*

https://preview.redd.it/3abtdv3cel881.jpg?width=1136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afeb49953eb908419f82630c2992d6c645da1da5

To be honest, at first I couldn't even figure out why that headline was on the GME ticker to begin with.   Must be some typical fluff in the article where they mention GME to make sure they attach this misleading headline to the ticker.  Then it hit me, ""Oh, they are responding through headlines to the superstonk reddit posts that created the current NFT Marketplace hype.  WTF?""

&#x200B;

Let's make this clear, they do not want GameStop NFT marketplace to be successful.  This breaks the mold about what they thought GameStop was, what and why they were shorting, and even what they thought it was going to be going forward.  This nft marketplace isn't just GameStop moving into e-commerce, which they can compare to other companies attempting the same and easily fud as GameStop makes this transition.  This marketplace is a **game**changer. *Enough of a gamechanger that MSM is prematurely trying to push another nft marketplace into IPO territory.*  Yesterday I made a post stating that GameStop NFT marketplace would be the only public company that had a NFT marketplace, which could lead to other major companies interested in creating NFTs being open to working with them.  The brand is on the public market, trustworthy, and accountable.  This made the front page.   Sure enough, the following day MSM releases a  fallacious headline mentioning OpenSea being a possible IPO for 2022.  Because, well, anything is *possible* right?  I guess it's not a lie if its possible.

They read our reddit and literally the next day counter any buzz points we make with **misleading** headlines.  This was no coincidence.

So what do I do?  I look into it.

The headline is deceptive, as opensea has publicly stated they are not planning an IPO.   On December 9, 2021, after a huge backlash within the OpenSea community, Chief financial officer Brian Roberts, is quoted as saying:

“Let me set the record straight: there is a big gap between thinking about what an IPO might eventually look like & actively planning one. **We are not planning an IPO,** and if we ever did, we would look to involve the community.”

Of course MSM ignores that, as that doesn't help stop GME's momentum.  Benzinga creates the headline, throws GME in the article with some fluff point to make sure it stickies to your ticker, and the brokers sit it right on top your favorite stonks news feed all day (and night).

Anyway.  I no longer believe anything with the GME ticker is a coincidence, glitch, or accident.  They see the momentum with the NFT marketplace, GameStop being a known brand, a publicly traded company, and hopefully first in the race to bring a NFT marketplace to the table for mainstream projects and releases (games, exclusive game items, collectables in nft form, sports collectables \*no longer need to pay to have a sports card verified authentic - nft does this for you\*, movie collectables, shoe collectables \*no longer need to keep our receipts due to counterfeiting\*).  If you believe in this group of guys running the company then you know they have bigger ideas than just transitioning to e-commerce.  The marketplace shows us that.  MSM can't let this happen and these fucking guys will stop at nothing.  They have name recognition, 1.4b on the back burner, no debt, and a markerplace in the works that could be a gamechanger (see the great reply below to see what this marketplace could mean for GameStop).  The bottom line is, this headline actually reinforces what we already knew, the new marketplace is a company changer, or a whole new company within a company.  Bullish.

And to reiterate, THIS IS WHY GME KEEP THEIR PLANS QUIET.  They know the media is against them and will purposely do the above to ANYTHING they announce."

Whatever stories they propagate, data they share, fud they print, bots and shills they deploy, or subreddits they destroy are as worthless as the USD is about to become. There is literally nothing they can say or do that will change my mind. Nothing they say or do will keep me from diamond handing GME in CS and buying more whenever I can.

The Reddit jig might soon be up but their jig is up too. They delved too far over this last year and betrayed themselves for the corrupt, lying frauds they are and now their fud has no effect whatsoever except to further reinforce my belief that GME is the play of the century."

**Quick Note from a Crayon Eatin' Dick Puncher**

Hello Apes - u/happy_dick_punch here. You might know me from my previous hits around glitches, shitposting memes, dropping some music covers, kicking around the banter or just eating some crayons round here.

Long story short, I’ve also got a background in digital. Been having some good discussions this past week related to the Reddit IPO stuff, backups, preserving, archiving and then considering the future. I own [gmeforever.com](http://gmeforever.com/) and offered that as a space if we want to think about utilizing it as a future house for whatever.

Ok, This post is about archiving all the folks who are talking and volunteering and want to consider collaborating. Putting this list together so you apes can have a place of reference to find, connect, engage, volunteer and hopefully keep things rolling. Lots of talented little silverback brains in here.

Been seeing and involved in a few discussions over the past week around building backups of our beloved home here on r/SuperStonk and preserving the archives while also considering how we might move forward in the future.

There have been great discussions and talking with people and seeing all the amazing talent.

I scraped a bunch of posts, comments and people who raised their hands to put together a list for organizing and archiving everyone who wants to be involved in various little projects, etc around digital, data, development, design, etc.

Below are some posts I have scraped with usernames.

One ran, controlled and funded by apes?? Or maybe we can contact GameStop or just see if they have a way we can all communicate? Don't get this shit twisted they are being bought out and eventually going to shut us and our communication/community down. We've taken matters into our own hands every step of the way and now our opponents is trying to outsmart us.. we have to be proactive with this shit if we want to stay on top and keep our community going. As always BUY, HOLD, DRS!!!🦧🚀

All I'm suggesting is depending on how all this goes we should be proactive with this. Would really suck to wake up one day and superstonk is gone"
255,12,"Let's Talk~ If anything, Reddit's actions last night with removing the Gradante post from main page and ""temporarily"" removing upvotes, shows us they will not make it easy to share information. Especially after they possibly IPO in the coming months.",311,rxee96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rxee96/lets_talk_if_anything_reddits_actions_last_night/,29,1641475043.0,"As the title says, once Reddit IPO's, the censorship will most likely only get worse. We need to be preparing ourselves for when this time comes. We've seen this week alone the upvote/downvote buttons be hidden on some accounts and now we see that if there is some ""potentially"" damaging information for the powers that be, Reddit will just magically ""have an outage"" to alter the performance of the post. 

Many of us primarily only get our information from upvoted posts on ""hot"" or ""DD flair"" on this sub or others like it. If the SHF, or others that are against us, can disrupt our flow of valuable information, that would be a powerful tool to use against us. Who knows, this may never come to fruition, but we need to come up with a way to pass on vital information just in case. I'm not entirely sure a way for us to avoid this. I know we have Gangum Style, but that doesn't seem like the best alternative method.

Y'all feel free to discuss below and maybe we can come up with something together. Then hopefully, if enough people agree, we can pin the instructions at the top of the sub (like the computershare instructions) so that it will be easily found by new apes down the road after MOASS starts and the FOMO crowd starts pouring in."

More importantly, Gamestop have started releasing updates. Every quarter we get to know how many of the total shares outstanding have been direct registered - by REAL named shareholders.

Price discovery, absolutely, categorically, has to be accurate once those shares are locked up. There's no hiding it.

Can they sell options once the float is locked - I don't know, seems like we would be entering unknown territory; a territory where technically 'market maker privileges' become null and void - there are no additional shares available.

That's the real crux of this. At that point, Gamestop shares are NO LONGER AVAILABLE. What happens then? What about all the thousands (probably millions) of people that haven't DRS'ed? What are they holding?

Just start the process. If you haven't already, start DRS'ing. The idea that you'll miss the MOASS is wrong. You can't miss the MOASS if the shares are locked up. It's impossible, where are they going to close short positions from?

Some perks for having them in your actual name:

* You're a real shareholder in a company you love.
* You will have the opportunity to receive whatever dividend they offer.
* (My personal favourite theory for the 741\*) Computershare isn't going to go bankrupt - they're a transfer agent, not a broker - your shares are safe.
* I think everyone is forgetting the fact that when the infinity pool is actually established, that's what will keep the price at astronomical levels. There's no coming down from that. Shares are locked by the transfer agent. People will sell when they feel the price is representative of their investment value. Even if you considered for a second that there would be no MOASS, the fair value of Gamestop will be in the thousands, and no one will sell before then. (And if a few people did - there will be thousands of people waiting to take their place.)
* This is a weird scenario - it will never happen again. Giveashare website has GME listed as number 1 gift purchase. Above Disney. Apes internationally, have been doing their thing and buying certificates just to open CS accounts to direct register. If anything (because of the time lags in postal) - we will start to see more CS momentum building.

\*741 is the start of the broker bankruptcy code. That seems way too coincidental to not be relevant for all the shitty brokers out there. RC has our back. [https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/](https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/)

As my final point - and it's controversial - I'm still wary of options. There is such a thing as dynamic investors (people who move the markets) and passive investors, basically retail). The last year has turned me into Brad Pitt from The Big Short (mentally of course...unfortunately not physically) . I don't trust any of it. That's why registering my shares through the transfer agent that is assigned directly by Gamestop, is the ONLY way I know I have actual shares in the company I love. And I do love it. It's going to the top apes, and we need to actually OWN it. Nothing is ever easy - make the move, direct register your shares now, and get included in the next report.

&#x200B;

Peace, love, apes together strong - 🚀🔜🌕

EDIT: It's amazing what they're capable of. They're experts in algorithms and a reddit algorithm will be pretty basic. You'ed be able to keep this post gaining upvotes while still downvoting systematically, and ultimately it will just die out in 'new'. On the other hand, any posts which are intended to deflect from DRS'ing, or are ultra pro for options - you can award and scale the upvotes in order to push it straight through to hot. Anyone who doesn't think we're being played, right here on our home turf (even before a Reddit IPO) is sorely mistaken. "
259,16,"🙈 Reddit Leadership - with their IPO conveniently happening now, and perhaps at the behest of Fidelity and company - are aggressively inserting themselves as the primary benefactor, profiteer, and racketeer in this historic MOASS 'Tug of War' between societal classes 🙈",259,rjq19k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rjq19k/reddit_leadership_with_their_ipo_conveniently/,37,1639892547.0,"Consider the timing as the evidence that supports this theory.  ""We're in the endgame now.""  As I have stated before, the clock is ticking, and the clock is not in our favor.  As many of us like to use the word 'zen' as if it justifies inaction, I beg to differ.

Many a great youtuber have been in agreeance on one thing: that shills and infiltrators, inside our open/free forums, are making every attempt to prevent MOASS while engaging in psychological warfare and issuing propaganda.  These shills and infiltrators are actually funded by the same entities who got caught red-handed in their illegal practice of destroying hundreds of American companies by shorting them to death, and while funding the media to force a false sentiment upon the masses.  We know these hedge funds are backed by their brokers, and who brazenly circumnavigate securities laws and financial regulations.  J.P. Morgan and Chase Co just admitted to guilt in their violation of securities laws.  Note: this news was released on a friday (the day where PR teams release news when they want to hide something or minimize their reputational harm).  Also read about Goldman Sachs fraud during the Great Recession, the $600B bailout, and how often the SEC (effectively dirty cops) accept hundred-million dollar deals in lieu of real justice.  Let us be crystal clear: you rarely, if ever, see any of these crooks behind bars where they belong.  They write a check instead.

But this writeup is not meant to become a sob story; I am no gadfly.  I want to discuss Reddit's IPO.

We know that Reddit, and its merit-based and open forum for discourse, was the root cause for January 2021.  Reddit allowed for Keith Gill, who is by fact a bold violator of FINRA regulations himself, to advocate for his stock.  GameStop was his all-in bet, and he advocated for over a year for his position (there were moments when that bet was not going well for him).  Yet, Warren Buffett does the same thing.  ""Advocating for your position"" is one of the long-standing rules of successful investing.  (why do you think Warren in his prime bought out so many news companies?)  Although YouTube and other forums were also used, Reddit allowed for a truthful discourse.  Free humans engaging in discussion, sharing of open information.  Yet, in terms of sentiment (which is the source of financial decision making) Reddit is the 'sentiment casino' itself.  Hedge Funds quickly want to become the Dealers in that casino.  As we know, the casino also wins.  After all, they design the games and their odds of winning.

Yet, on the same day that J.P. Morgan was caught ($200M fine), they issue a 'distraction' all over CNBC?  The distraction to their financial crimes was about short selling.  Why?  Well, because the Department of Justice and SEC are busy right now, as they have stated that there is an active CRIMINAL investigation into short-selling practices, specifically.  Essentially, J.P. Morgan being a broker for Melvin Capital (legal Target) quickly went from Group of Interest to Subject.  They paid a lot of money to avoid prosecution on Friday.  Notice, however, that J.P. Morgan jumped on the news to issue propaganda about their take: that a short squeeze is inevitable now, through Christmas, and into year-end.  Because Federal prosecutors were criminally interviewing J.P. Morgan all week, they likely 'jumped ship' onto the good side and, on the same day of the $200M penalty, spoke in favor (all of a sudden) of a short squeeze.  This is why I believe that there will be no fake squeeze, and instead the one squeeze will simply be MOASS.

Reddit Leadership, on the other hand, has been the sole entity in this saga (and very innocent, mind you) who was not attempting to profit.  Apes (mostly low class, some middle class, and few upper class) want MOASS.  That's profit (advocating for their position). Brokers and Hedge Funds (all upper class and connected with the ruling elite) don't want MOASS (shills advocating for their position).  But, as we spoke about before, the medium for advocating for your position is the real money-maker.  In Warren Buffett's day, it was the newspaper companies.  Today, it's the internet.  For investing, though, Reddit just became the ultimate newspaper company for top investors to try to advocate from. Hedge funds and brokers, therefore, know that this is their only and last chance to infiltrate the source - Reddit - in order for them to try to prevent MOASS.  For these reasons, combined with the fact that FUDelity's $400M was one of the largest and earliest funding in their pre-IPO rounds, I believe Reddit Leadership was solicited.  I believe that Reddit Leadership probably did not want to go public, but that their company became what will forever be known as the battleground for the largest sentiment war for the largest potential transfer of wealth to other societal classes in human history.

And they may have just sold us out for their own gain.  And what is the other problem with this?  Any funds that us Apes use in the quest to buy 51% of Reddit right now are funds not going into GameStop.

With all of this stated, I like the idea of the real MOASS occurring right now, while the prosecution of the Federal Government onto the criminal hedge funds and criminal brokers is clearly so actively hot.  

TLDR;  Reddit Leadership wants to profit from the Apes vs Hedge Fund 'Tug of War.'  Maybe they just wisened up to this spontaneously, or maybe they were given an offer they couldn't refuse?  Reddit is effectively the 'sentiment casino', so who will become the Dealers?  But, the Reddit IPO just became a new financial battleground in the hedge funds' latest, we're-in-the-endgame-now-level distraction to GME.  Thus, only after MOASS occurs, and Ken Griffin is in jail, we can then (and only then) consider diversifying slightly from our GME positions and into the modern day newspaper companies like Reddit, where we can forever-ensure fairness and equal opportunity in the sharing of free, public information."

I'm thinking once it IPOs, the objectivity that reddit once boasted will be lost forever, and of course Reddit will be at the beck and call of the major shareholders, which will most definitely be wallstreet FIs.

Then they'll hire some black market hacker to hack and delete the few DD repositories that's not on reddit, like that DD library someone made. 

And with this erasure of all the DD that exposes their shit, and by removing one of the only platforms we have to communicate these atrocities, they would hope that the excellent DDs that expose them will never resurface again. 

This is why I think apes who are computer science inclined should protect the DDs with some high tech CS stuff, but I'm not one of these apes."

I've seen a lot of chatter about [Ally Investments](https://www.ally.com/invest/). Some apes have decided to take the plunge, others still wait perched on the brokerage fence deliberating whether or not they would want to transfer their GME shares that reside in their IRA.

First, I'd like to remind each and everyone of you that it is your choice whether you choose to move your IRA over to Ally or Not.

So why move your IRA? So that your GME shares can be directly registered through ComputerShare.

There are countless apes eager to see the float locked via direct registration. As such you would be wise to remember that although apes are encouraging this action they are none the wiser than you. So do your research first. That's just what I've been doing... I'm sure some of you have as well, so let's hear your thoughts in the comments!!

At first glance I'm not particularly impressed by their recent history.

[Whenever you hear subprime think \\""Shit\\""](https://preview.redd.it/l9tvd6wla5781.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bf110e62782cae23b2d1ba7ad02f6e708caf993)

That's right subprime loans... I know what you're thinking, ""but but everyone was doing it back in the day. We all smoked crack, banana peels, and snorted coke off a donkey dick somewhere in South America."" ***Wait you weren't thinking that?*** Well that's because we all weren't doing that... just some people, and not all banks / financial institutions were slanging subprime loans to unsuspecting citizens who were just looking for a home. But ALLY was.... oh I'm sorry it was a subdivision of Ally ""[**Nuvell Financial Services**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuvell_Financial_Services)**""  AND THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.**

Not surprised GMAC Commercial Holdings AKA  **Capmark** filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and ultimately acquired by Berkadia (a [joint venture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture) of [Leucadia National](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferies_Financial_Group) and [Berkshire Hathaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway).)

So lets fast forward to 2014 where they had their IPO and in 2016 acquired **TradeKing** which was rebranded to **Ally Invest.** Nasdaq shows that [Ally's institutional ownership](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ally/institutional-holdings) is 90.52% So who are these institutions?

[F\*cking sus](https://preview.redd.it/u1i0mef5f5781.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd11b4a970a7fa03ce1e0732580f24c690981224)

I find it interesting that Fidelity and Goldman have considerably reduced their exposure. However, I find it more interesting that both Vanguard and Fidelity have some significant holdings in a company that will DRS our shares (as a custodian) but neither of them will do so themselves directly. (Also worth noting that you should sort by Change % and Change(shares) to see who's come and gone... )

I'd like to know more about TradeKing, other than they were ""fined $5,000 by FINRA after it failed to fully report transactions in its regular audit of trading activity. About 10 percent of transactions were excluded from the audit."" Interesting nonetheless... Maybe one of you apes knows more?

I was able to find out more on [fines issued to Ally Financial and it's subsidiaries.](https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/ally-financial) Not exactly Mr. Clean, but somewhat expected given their past with subprime loans. Yet here are some of the Fines for those who don't want to view the link:

Finally on to their 2016 reentry into the mortgage business (direct-to-consumer offering called Ally Home). In April 2019, **Ally Home partnered with Better.com** to launch a digital mortgage platform.Wait... [BETTER.COM?!?](https://BETTER.COM?!?) Why does this sound familiar?  Hmm yes this [piece of DD from 9 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mnnvcq/for_those_dd_gods_on_the_everything_short/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&user_id=699112216640&web_redirect=true)

>It processed $25B worth of mortgage refinancing transactions in 2020 and $14B in Q1 2021

That's a lot of refinancing... but ""quick pre-approval, instant loan estimates, rate locks, lower rates, and fees.""  \*\*\*Who doesn't love Quick Pre-Approval?!?!?\*\*\*If you all recall, [Better..com fired 15% of their staff over zoom the other week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Miq85pDnfX8). They must not being doing too well.

Apes... your mission should you accept is to dig a little deeper, ask more questions, find out more. Disagree with my concerns? Great!!! **Tell us why though**, **back up your opinion with data and share it with the community.** I'm not the only one weary of transferring my GME shares from my IRA to Ally. So lets put our wrinkles together and hopefully more neurons will ignite some meaningful conversation.

TLDR: WTF is Ally and why do they not seem like my ALLY?  As it stands I'd rather take the taxable event and DRS myself with no custodian.

As always, BUY HOLD DRS (rinse repeat)!!!

Edit #2: Thanks to u/winebutch for commenting about [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rm8ztl/drs_your_ira_using_local_credit_union_as_custodian/). Apparently other alternatives for custodians are our local credit Unions!!  


Edit #3:  As [/u/DaDudeAbidesAgain](https://www.reddit.com/u/DaDudeAbidesAgain/) pointed out, they also use Apex. Who, if you recall, turned off the buy button back in January. "
