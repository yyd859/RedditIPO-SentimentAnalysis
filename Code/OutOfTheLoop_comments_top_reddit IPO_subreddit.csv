1,hp0md4x,t3_riuusy,"Answer: Mostly, whenever a company goes public the assumption is they have achieved their primary goal, in case of reddit, setting up a giant dominant platform for forum on the internet. When they go public they will get investors and would focus primarily on generating profit for the shareholders. 

People think while doing this reddit would priotirize nuking ""controversial"" subreddits because they bring bad press to the product and investors won't like that. They would focus on monetization by adding more ads, maybe getting rid of third party apps in an effort to make reddit more closed and centralized (already started over the past couple years with profiles). The core reddit experience would be taken away for something which would just another social media company like Facebook. 

Something like piracy or NSFW  would be in far more danger now. The fear isn't completely unfounded.

EDIT: One important and obvious thing that I probably should have written clearly. Reddit already has investors like any other company. All giant companies have private investors and companies work towards generating profit. The new thing now is when reddit goes public retail investors like us will buy in as well and people fear that the things happening over the past few years (aggressive moderation in certain areas) will be doubled down. This doesn't mean reddit is suddenly go to remove all third party apps. End of an era. Jump ship. Nope. I'm just saying that is the general popular sentiment right now when the news broke.",t3_riuusy,4428,OutOfTheLoop

5,hp0w839,t3_riuusy,"Answer: When a company goes public the investors want only one thing, a return on their investment. What happened to Yahoo and Tumblr is the future for Reddit.

6,hp14yb7,t3_riuusy,"Answer: While everyone is going on that investors want money - that's also true for the current owners. But I don't think they'll massively change the formula - it was always about making money from its users. ""You are the product"" is almost right, more specifically, you are the unpaid employee. The value of reddit is the content its users leave behind, which attracts more users, whose attention it can then monetize. If you mess around with that formula too much, too fast, the users will leave and you kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.

So no, I don't think you'll see any noticeable change in 1 year. But if I'd had to bet, my guess would be they'd go the way off twitter: Slowly kill off 3rd party apps, since those just show the content, without bringing in money through ads.",t3_riuusy,139,OutOfTheLoop

10,hp17xdh,t3_riuusy,Answer: the idea is that the platform will no longer allow free speech that is against the interests of its large institutional investors. Look at Twitter and Facebook removing posts related to certain topics. Reddit is one of the few platforms that didn’t. Look at what Reddit achieved this year so far from an activism standpoint. I’m not going into the details but a few subreddits alone are changing the world. The opinion of those changes is up to you.,t3_riuusy,50,OutOfTheLoop
11,hoznh4m,t3_riuusy,"Answer: Going public means Reddit will be opening it's doors to public investors, and be listed on the stock market, so you, or I, or anyone else can become a shareholder of the company.

How will it effect us?

It probably won't effect the average user, other social media companies like Twitter, Snapchat and Facebook have already been listed on the stock market for years.",t3_riuusy,120,OutOfTheLoop
12,hp24vpp,t3_riuusy,"Answer: companies often want to raise money to do things like expand, enter new markers, develop new products, etc. There are two ways of doing that. The first is to take on debt. They take out a loan from a bank, or issue bonds, which they must pay back with interest. This is the only obligation when they take on debt; a lender can't tell them how to run the company, or what they can and can't do. All they can do is wait to be paid back.

But when it comes to borrowing, companies aren't all that different from individuals. Some are creditworthy, and some are not, and banks/bond buyers rate them accordingly, and charge higher or lower interest on their loans. A stable and profitable company can get a loan at a very low (cheap) interest rate, while a less well-established or struggling company will only be able to get a higher rate. This is bad, because high interest rates on loans eat into whatever gains they hoped to make by borrowing the money in the first place.

This is when companies look at the second way of raising capital, which is selling off ownership. Think of Shark Tank. An owner of a business agrees to give away equity, a percentage of ownership in the company, in exchange for cash. Unlike a loan, there is no fixed time or amount or any other requirement to pay that money back. However, an equity investor does have more rights than a lender. 

If a company runs at a profit, an equity investor who owns 20% of the company also is entitled to 20% of those earnings. The management of the company thus needs to distribute that money, OR use it to improve/grow. As a result, the company has a legal obligation to manage itself in the best interests of its owners, which gives investors some sway in dictating how the company conducts itself.

When a company ""goes public"", it means they are raising money by selling an ownership share of the company not just to a single investor/owner, but many investors, including the general public. They sell millions of very small shares to anyone who wants to own them. They buy them because they think the company will continue to improve, and therefore either pay out a share of the profit, or reinvest wisely and become more valuable.

Small shareholders, even those with just a tiny fraction of ownership, have all the same rights as large shareholders. Meaning they have sway in how the company is run in their best interests. Most people don't exercise those rights though, and instead delegate them to a proxy - such as the mutual fund they own that actually buys their shares, for example. Those groups are large enough to actually influence decisions that a company makes.

Sometimes the interests of those shareholders don't align well with the philosophy of a company's founders. Or their customers. They may cajole them into things like changing suppliers, or raising prices, or  shutting down underperforming products. By choosing to go public, and bring on new investors, the company had to weigh their need for debt-free cash against how much change and loss of control they were willing to put up with. 

In the case of reddit, they have decided to go public to raise new capital. They have previously raised cash from investors in private rounds, first from angel investors, then incubators, then silicon valley venture capital funds, and more recently large corporate investors (e.g. Tencent). Any of those owners can now sell on the open market to get their money (and probably more) back. If they decide to cash out, supply and demand says that when there's a lot of something for sale (e.g. shares) the price goes down. This is and for investors, so Reddit is obligated to keep their investors happy.

What is unknown is exactly what keeping them happy will mean in terms of concrete decisions about things that affect users. The frequency of ads? Moderating certain content? Who knows. The point is, if you previously, as a user, trusted the product vision of the company, there's now other cooks in the kitchen. One might be fearful that a thing they enjoy will change in a way they don't appreciate. Hence, all the hoopla.",t3_riuusy,2,OutOfTheLoop

110,hp2jlwr,t1_hp0zw7q,"Disagreed. Retaining old users isn’t necessarily important in the short-term as long as you manage to keep the total amount of users growing.

Reddit will likely become more and more sterilized akin to the larger social media platforms, which in turn will open up the gates for a competitor to rise that will eventually take over as the new “front page of the internet”. 

Moderating content vs. Letting the community run wild are opposing forces, and any growing social media platform will eventually run into the issue of sterilizing the community to continue growing (in order to please shareholders and gain mainstream appeal) or continue with business as usual. 

Unfortunately, most platforms choose the former (not 4chan though - hats off to Nishimura) which eventually leads to the platform decaying as the original users who made it great in the first place leave. Usually, the commercialization and newly introduced moderation will usually generate profits for a couple of years, until the platform either stagnates or withers away as another platform takes its place.

I’m buying Reddit stock though. We like the stock. But I’m not holding it for the long run, if any of their PC bullshit moderation policies are anything to go by. That stuff is gonna kill the community and cause an exodus.",t3_riuusy,9,OutOfTheLoop

Investors looking to invest in NFTs, anticipating Bitcoin level profits, will invest in reddit as part of their hedged NFT investment portfolio.

As well when a company goes public there's more than one type of stock. But in this case the difference between voting and non-voting stock is what's important. A public company will have a share holder's meeting on a regular basis, usually yearly.

At this meeting shareholders with voting stock can vote on various issues the company is facing including replacing any and all board members. So even if we have board members that are Reddit community focused this can change, in a heart beat. While it's not a guarantee, any and all changes both good for the users and not will always be a possibility.

In the end due to the profit motive I see Reddit changing, possibly a lot. How long it will take and how disruptive the changes will be is anyone's guess.

When you go public, now a group of people have voting rights and can periodically have meetings about the company's direction. In theory they can vote to dramatically change your policies or GTFO.

Tumblr wasn't either bud. But if 1 portion of the entire group migrates, it'll lower usage in other areas as well as a function of time 

It's a parasitic idea. If you remove 10% of the user base because of a lack of content that made them stay on reddit, the usage in other subreddits will drop and engagement will lower as well with less content and interaction. This is the parasitic quality in losing users

It's part of why other social media entities like tiktok/facebook/instagram/Twitter have engagement algorithms. Reddits algorithm is simple if you're a user. You see top posts from your pick of subreddits. If you lose some subreddits, you're losing engagement. Reddit, unless they change their intentions for ***new*** interaction on the website, can't combat losing a significant amount of users. In this case, a drop in a few percent could be pretty significant 


>and it would absolutely create a situation that invites a competitor, but I don't think it would devalue the company anywhere near the same scale it did Tumblr
