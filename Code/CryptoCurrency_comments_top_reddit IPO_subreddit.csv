5,hp47z03,t3_rjl893,"I’d posted something similar about Twitter when Dorsey got ousted.  Something like this will eventually happen, but atm you’d need a lot of marketing to get enough people to participate. For instance ConstitutionDAO only raised like 10 or 15 million and that one had a lot of publicity.  Even if we got 10 or 100 times that still wouldn’t be enough for even a board seat, let alone control. But the DAO could buy a non negligible amount with a stated goal of increasing their share until they have control. It’ll be interesting if this is ever attempted. At a certain point, people who are interested in investing in the company would have to choose between buying their own share or a share in the DAO and who knows how something like this would impact the valuation.

The DAO could be registered in Wyoming. That would give it the legal personality and capacity to engage in actions.

In the end, it was a novelty news piece for a couple days that mostly just confirmed the mainstream news' typical talking points: billionaires are our friends, crypto users are idealistic dorks who are doomed to fail, and that future will look just like the past, ie. a boot continuously stomping on the necks of the underclasses.

Charging something like 1000 shib/month just to be apart of that sub, and that only giving you a 1000 votes up or down a month. Top 10 posters get a reward equaling 1% each of the total revenue brought in that month. Next top 40 get .5% each. It would limit the amount of bots we do see. Incentives good posters. What ever bots are still there will be paying into the site in order to shill or vote. Since Reddit is keeping 70% of the fee and max 1% for the poster it never works out that bots become profitable by overloading the sub. Reddit doesn’t have to charge you anything directly just send over from your wallet. Anyone can view a sub but in order to participate you pay the membership fee.

634,horupgb,t3_rhmjuw,"This will probably be an unpopular comment and down voted but I'm skeptical of the bull case for a sustained rise in the value of community coins with a reddit IPO. Sure, the value will likely increase some with a growing user base but I don't see the value proposition that would drive non-community members to invest in moons long term or what would drive an organic increase in demand.

I could be missing some of the functionality of moons, so please correct me if I'm missing anything, but is there anything that you can purchase with moons that you can't directly purchase with fiat? 

Admittedly, I couldn't care less about customizing my avatar or signature so I'm not the target consumer, but to me moons only serve a function if their cost to me is 0, or at least less than the equivalent cost of the services/goods I can exchange them for. I'm happy to receive moons only so long as I don't have to pay for them. That sets a hard practical upper limit on the value of a moon or any other community token, regardless of the token's scarcity. 

Scarcity of the asset doesn't drive increased asset value because once the asset value exceeds the limit defined by the fiat equivalent of the Reddit commodities that the CC can be exchanged for, it no longer makes sense to purchase moons. The only reason I can think of to purchase moons at a value greater than that is bragging rights (look, I have more moons than you) but that will only matter to a very small group of users.

Outside of exchanging CC's for Reddit commodities and bragging rights, what other utility should I, or others, believe in that would suggest this project is anything more than a way to get premium content from Reddit for free? Don't get me wrong, I think that's a good feature of Reddit, but I don't see how that translates into sustained price growth.

Outside of the practical value limit as a unit of exchange for Reddit commodities, a price increase could be driven by degenerate speculation (afterall, how many people really DYOR before fomoing into a coin?). However, my assumption is that would only drive a short term price spike to an ATH; followed by a dump once the hype wears off.

I'm not bashing moons (as you can see I hold a few), just trying to provide the counter case to OP's hopium.

Remember how all of the tech stocks plummeted around the year 2000? Some of them rebounded a bit because there was a panic sell to preserve some of the investors assets (retirement accounts?).

Then, a few companies that actually still had customers had their stock value rebound to its historical average value.

I can name two that stood out. Ebay and AOL. The month after the panic-sell, millions of people were still auctioning and having ""sell now"" sales on ebay, and millions of people were still emailing and instant-chatting each other on AOL. They still got paid for posting ads, their core service was still being used by millions of customers, just as much as before the horrific economic ""correction"".

If crypto takes a dump, buy the dip my brothers. People in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Turkey will still be doing business buying stuff from China with crypto, and selling those items in their home country with crypto. Like El Salvador.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano are like having three different ""paypals"" that are trusted, and people using their SERVICE to perform a function. There are issues, but crypto has an even brighter future, because there is competition to prove that your crypto is better in some way, and they are improving every day. 

Security, low fees, ease of use, etc...

After the first of the year, I will sell the crypto I have on paypal, but...that was the first crypto I bought, because I unexpectedly saw that I could now buy crypto on paypal, and all it took was three clicks.

I have since moved on to other ways to buy crypto, but the lesson remains. Crypto is a service, where financial transactions can take place. Cuba does not accept US dollars, and wire transfers can only be done Mon-Fri during the day, but...a person in Cuba can make a transaction with crypto at any hour of the day or night.

China banned crypto several times, with the full power of the fascist dictatorial central government. And yet...crypto is still available to anyone in China.

$USD used to be backed by gold in Ft Knox, and Nixon took us off the gold standard so the central government can print money, because the population was growing faster than the supply of mined gold.

The Doge/SHIB comparison was not me comparing moons to meme coins. It was to portray a picture. Meme coin without a use case, whitepaper, or a legal entity behind it, banking only on Elon tweeting about it has a $25B mcap. If proper use case is developed for moons, when we get on the mainnet, with Reddit behind it, with the user base it has, I don't see why it could not reach that kind of mcap. Especially in the next bull run.
