I feel like this will get a big pump and dump just due to how reddit astroturfs everything. The entire front page will be artificially designed to pump the stock. All the mods I'm sure will be getting shares of some sort so any DD that goes against will be permaband.

I cant see how reddit will improve by having its mods now be financially incentived to ban differing opinions.

This logic is only valid if you’ve been continuing to buy at this current price. Have you?

Edit: You’re holding because you believe there’s a slight chance the stock might go back up and you can break even. If that’s your belief, wouldn’t it make sense to buy shares at only 50% of your cost basis, so that when it does go back up, you can actually profit?

Also another edit because I post my comments too early:

With this logic, your only other “choice” is to ride it to zero since you won’t sell for a loss. Essentially you’d rather lose everything you invested, or break even. Profiting off this investment is entirely off the table for you because you (probably) aren’t buying more shares at this current price to lower your cost basis",t3_rhr40s,2,wallstreetbets

What do Reddit users think about the Reddit IPO?

Reddit users on the forum r/WallStreetBets have already vocalised their concerns about the move to take the firm public. The main criticism seems to be that as a listed company, Reddit will need to start generating more income to please shareholders, which could result in users seeing more advertising and modifications to the experience.

How much is Reddit worth?

Reddit was valued at $10 billion in a private fundraising round in August 2021, but by the time of its IPO, the online message board company is aiming for a valuation of more than $15 billion.

What does Reddit do?

Reddit is an online discussion board and community, founded in 2005 by Steve Huffman and late activist Aaron Swartz. Despite not being as popular as other social media firms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, Reddit has made its name with niche – and often controversial – discussion groups.

Reddit has more than 100,000 communities, in which over 53 million active daily users share their thoughts and ideas on a range of topics. In fact, Reddit is currently the 19th-most-visited website on the internet, and the sixth-most-popular social networking site.

The site allows users to post anonymously, which is supposed to encourage honestly and transparency. Any post can be voted on by the community; posts with the largest number of up votes are viewed more and hold greater authority.

Most recently, Reddit has become a hub of retail investors, flocking to the board r/WallStreetBets to discuss tips and ideas on stock trading. The community – known as a subreddit – was responsible for the rise of GameStop and other so called ‘meme stocks’. Their intentions were to profit as hedge funds covered their short positions, in what’s known as a short squeeze.

How does Reddit make money?

Reddit makes its money through advertising on its site. It reported that in Q2 2021, it made $100 million in ad revenue – three times the amount it made in Q2 2020.

For users who don’t want ads on their feeds, there is a ‘premium membership’ available, which grants an ad-free experience as well as full access to the r/lounge, 700 free monthly coins, and other benefits. The membership costs $5.99 per month or $49.99 per year.

Reddit also generates money through Reddit Coins, which are virtual goods that Reddit users can purchase in bundles and gift to other Reddit users to reward them for their contributions and good content. Coin bundles cost between $1.99 to $199.99.

Other benefits to users holding Reddit Coins include access to the r/lounge. Which is an exclusive subreddit group for Premium members only.

Reddit has also raised capital through eight rounds of fundraising, generating a total of $919 million from 27 different institutional investors.

Is Reddit profitable?

No, Reddit isn’t yet profitable. In 2020, Reddit reported $170 million in revenue.

What is Reddit's business strategy?

Reddit’s business strategy thus far is a pretty odd one, given that the firm sacrifices the opportunity to make money in order to keep its users happy. As we’ve seen, advertising space sales are the company’s primary revenue stream. However, Reddit does not require email addresses and does not track personal information, losing out on the opportunity to increase advertising through data exploitation, in order to keep its users anonymous.

And this is where one of the biggest challenges Reddit could face comes in: regulation. Due to the anonymity of users, there’s always the possibility of malpractice and manipulation, such as bots or even hedge funds driving users toward certain stocks. Reddit does already have moderators in place, but once it’s a public firm the level of scrutiny it’ll face will likely increase. Any thread to the anonymity of users could cause an exodus from the platform.

After half a decade neglecting its ad platform, Reddit has begun to invest heavily in this area before it goes public, so we may see the company reach profitability by 2022.

Reddit announced in 2020 that it was buying video creation app Dubsmash, entering into direct competition with TikTok.

The company also just hired its first ever chief financial officer, Drew Vollero (previous CFO for SNAP) in what many see as preparation for its IPO.

Who owns Reddit?

Reddit is owned by Condé Nast Publications, a global media company, who bought the company from founders Huffman and Ohanian one year after it was created for $10 to $20 million.

Current investors in Reddit also include Fidelity Investments, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Tencent Holdings.

The future of Reddit is likely going to be a few subreddits that are popular, while smaller communities build up the foundation of the site and fulfill stuff like Google search results. Most users will find themselves using a few subreddits

My expectation is that Reddit will actually invest in communities rather than investing in tech or advertisers as much as people fear. That's the real moat here.

But reddit sure as shit hasn't modded/censored out the socialist communist propaganda all over imgur spammed there every day like clockwork via reddit.  If it get's worse with more inflows of that crap I may bail, but alas reddit as a whole has left most censorship power to the subreddit mod divisions in large part.

Reddit can’t catch everything that quickly as subreddits pop up so things will squeak by until it’s not noted until much later. 

Another user mentioned Twitter didn’t ban porn, but I want to say that Reddit banning porn would be easier since they can just make the subreddit creation process harder and mass ban entire subreddits quite easily compared to Twitter and banning users.

1933,hp1pbon,t3_rj5cgx,"I think the real important thing with this IPO is to recognize that reddit exposure for reddit stock will probably create a surge in performance before the eventual downswing in stock Price. Just because logically the IPO may create censorship issues for the users does not mean people wont buy this IPO. So no matter how you feel about it i think it’s foolish to not make money on both ends of this trade. 

EXAMPLE : HOOD. Most reasonable people agree robinhood is a garbage brokerage , but we still know that tons of millenials use it and thus we saw a huge price surge for about 1 week after IPO. Didnt matter that it was a garbage company a bunch of autists still bought the stock. Hedgefunds probably also rode the wave and took advantage of the hype and then sold their shares near the top. I think we see a similar run to Robinhood. 

So in my opinion the move here is to Buy shares at IPO day, ride the wave, lock in gainz and then contemplate a short position or buying puts. Use the whole animal, make money on both sides of the trade.

I also think fundamentally the value to shareholders of buying into an IPO is that you’re giving money to a company to invest in their platform or tech or advertising to increase sales/users/engagement. How would Reddit do these things with our money? How would our money increase future growth/revenue/profits? What technology or growth would investing in them bring? What are they going to do or change in the app and how would that make it add users or profits? Nothing. It’ll be like Twitter stock where a mature (age not content, per se) platform doesn’t show increased users, monetization, or profits.

SPAC's became the go to move for companies (both sketchy and legit) to get into this investor dogpile quickly since its faster than a full IPO.  Now, the market is less bullish and people are moving investments away to less risky stocks. The SPAC craze appears to be slowing also.  

Rivian was probably the last hurrah of the throw money at a tech IPO or SPAC, and everyone saw it tank pretty hard after a huge hype up to 170$

————————————————————————

I think they just want to cash out while they can still guarantee a relatively high IPO. 

This is just my opinion, but the IPO market has been insane the past 2 years. Countless companies raising record capital and some being overvalued. I believe the cycle is winding down, and that this is their last chance to get a higher than normal IPO and cash out (at least for the short term). 

Not all of the data below directly relates to Reddit IPO, but they are all intertwined. When the equity market is frothy, SPACS popping off, crypto going bananas, etc, this allows companies to IPO higher. Markets dont like uncertainty. If Russia attacks Ukraine, and lets say threatens European countries to not intervine or they cut their oil/gas (this is all extremely speculative, just trying to create an example) this will have an impact on markets. Could amplify other macro events and markets go lower, then Reddit cannot raise as much at IPO. 

My reasoning:

-	S&P 500 is set to end higher this year for the third year in a row. Analysts predict a rally in 2022, but a four year streak has only happened 5 times in the past century
-	Fed announcing 3 rate hikes for 2022
-	Crypto/NFT mania seems to be cooling off
-	Winter season with Omnicron variant/covid/flu
-	S&P and Nasdaq are heavily weighted and being held up by a few tech giants. Look under the hood at all the other companies and their returns
-	2021 record year for IPOs and SPACs; see below
-	SPAC boom/bust: most SPACs are down since the boom in February. CLOV down 73% YTD, SPCE down 37.7% YTD, OPEN down 40% YTD, SOFI up 20%. ($2.45) YTD
-	Recent IPOs: Coinbase down 29% since IPO, Rivian down 25% since IPO, Bumble down 56% since IPO, Robinhood’s ath after their IPO was $85, is now trading $19.10, Oatly down 64% since IPO, Coursera down 47% since IPO, Lemonade (2020 IPO) down 59% YTD, Beyond (2019 IPO) down 52% YTD, Peloton (2019 IPO) down 71% YTD
-	2020 IPO Upstart Holdings up 216% YTD, but has been on a downtrend since hitting all time high in October. Past 3 months is down 54%. I call this out as an example of frothy, since the clip of someone pumping this on CNBC and couldn’t answer when asked what the company does
-	Oil/Gas issues. When oil went negative in 2020, some refineries and pumps were permanetly closed. CNBC and Bloomberg had oil people on who explained this. You cant just quickly reopen/restart them. US crude oil production is projected to return to 2019 levels in 2023. The amount of crude oil processed at US refineries is projected to return to 2019 levels by 2025. 

As I previously stated, this is all my opinion. I’m a complete amateur. I love this stuff and am trying to become a trader at a firm, but realistically I dont know anything and am probably wrong about a lot. I’ve been wrong countless times in 2020/21.",t3_rj5cgx,2,wallstreetbets

Many of you all don’t talk to OF girls or sex workers, so there’s a lot of false narrative out there that don’t even make sense when critical thought is applied. And it’s exactly how the religious right wants it to be, so ppl like you, spew misinformation that frames the issue as “Onlyfans bad” instead of realizing that the religious right is censoring your internet content. 

FYI: MasterCard changed their vendor rules in October due to SESTA FOSTA. Onlyfans payment processor changed to ccbill in November, with this change came numerous crackdowns on content, and major content policies updated restricting BDSM content and certain 3rd party content to adhere to their new payment processor rules. Idk about you but it definitely sounds like they planned to get rid of explicit content, saw the backlash, CCBill likely struck a good deal with them, and they reversed their decision.",t3_rj5cgx,26,wallstreetbets
2349,hp4bskv,t1_hp46ih8,"You’re mistaken, they originally were going to get rid of all explicit content including penetration, masturbation, or and hardcore acts. When they reversed, their new processor and guidelines of MasterCard is what caused them to get stricter on CNC. Their initial decision was to only allow soft core porn, very similar to what happened to Patreon as they used to allow hardcore stuff on there way back but their payment processor (PayPal) did not want explicit content. OF’s payment processor literally changed in November. Hence why you can now purchase a subscription without “Onlyfans” showing on the statement it is now CCBill, which has stricter guidelines for the sexual content they will process payments for. That’s why kink stuff got restricted. Not because they weren’t planning on banning porn. They very much were planning on banning hardcore stuff, the email they sent is literally all over Twitter. And the amount of users they lost in that time would be antithetical to any subscription based website’s agenda. 

Reddit probably won’t ban porn, I assume they will do what Twitter does and “shadowban” adult content creators from their search bars, and restrict NSFW subreddits from purchasing awards to make sure they aren’t violating SESTA FOSTA. Similar to how sex workers can’t monetize their accounts on Twitter. The current SESTA FOSTA lawsuit against Reddit is actually garbage, but that still means Reddit is on their radar and them going public makes it 10x easier to stir up commotion and scare investors without having to do a lawsuit. There’s lots of stuff going on there.",t3_rj5cgx,9,wallstreetbets

As for « genuinely violent » again depends what you’re referring to, but there were some dissident political subs or even non-political but made comments admins didn’t like that got nuked. 

Reddit used to be a very free speech place, everyone understood that there were subs you didn’t like on the site but that doesn’t mean you take them down, it means you just don’t visit there. Even just having an axe dangling over the head of any subreddit that wants to touch certain topics changes the culture. 

Reddit made an effort to become more palatable to the average user, and in doing so invited the staleness and « safety » that the rest of social media suffers from. 

Even just making it possible for people like that to remain here makes subreddits like r/againsthatesubreddits possible where mods don’t even need to hate a sub to axe it, because those users can just report or false flag any sub out of existence. 

Old users will remember the reaction to the banning of r/fph or r/coontown, people weren’t huge fans of those subs but everyone understood how serious a precedent it was. Now subs getting banned is just part of how the website works, that was unthinkable 10 years ago.

[This is a very common graph](https://wildfirecomms-images.co.uk/img/ebbinghaus-diagram-1-1479295300.png) explaining how spaced repetition works when doing study techniques. 

Now unfortunately for us, advertisers also know this science - and they know that we don't have a conscious way to control what our brain learns - and they decided to use this knowledge to make life suckier for the rest of us by making more and more effective ads, tailored to get inside our brains and minds and stay there.

The reason companies pay for ads at the end of a video, or to rerun a shortened ad just a few mins after running a full ad, is because it's a very effective way to make your brain ""learn"" the ad.

(If you ever wondered why kids seems to have such an easier time learning about brands and products than learning say math or history, the sad fact is that the ad firms have a way better grasp of both the science and the practical parts of learning than most teachers - granted, they also have far more resources and incentives, but still...)",t3_rii7x8,5,wallstreetbets

It's where you go if you want to talk to (mostly) real people. Monetization is the antithesis of authenticity. When you start trying to make money off something, you fundamentally take away it's authenticity. Look at the news media for a good example...its continued push toward monetization has corrupted it on a deeper level than most ever thought possible. What I'm getting at is that Reddit+IPO is like oil+water, baking soda+vinegar, matter+antimatter. They cannot coexist in the same place. The IPO of Reddit will be the beginning of the end of Reddit.

A good example of a company that didn’t focus on monetization as much as they “should” have after IPO was Twitter. Dorsey kept it authentic-ish compared to what he could have done. Now that he’s out and it has “moved on from its founders”, I imagine TWTR earnings results are going to go up and up",t3_rqvwxm,1,wallstreetbets
4334,hqhv8uw,t1_hqer9da,">Everything that happens after an IPO is in the interest of making as much money as possible for shareholders.

Not exactly.  The markets intent is also to provide a source of funding for the companies AFTER IPO.  That's why it's in the companies best interest to continue being as attractive to potential share holders as possible to keep the price inflated in case they ever need to raise capital by issuing additional equity.  This is especially true for most companies shortly after IPO in the ramp up growth (S curve in manufacturing).  For example, watch Rivian issue shares in the 2nd quarter.

While I agree that it's difficult for many companies to go public when doing so seems the antithesis of core mission since shareholders want profits first, it's not impossible.  Especially with a new bread of share holders with a focus on ESG.  

But totally agree that ""going public"" can ruin the nature of some companies. For example, my business buys product from a company that just went public last year.  They offer a remote maintenance cloud management product my business had come to rely on.  They offer the software to dealers for free that buy their hardware.  We in turn offer our clients support and maintenance packages for monthly reoccurring revenue.   I know they are going to start charging us for it now that they are public.  As a shareholder, I want them to.  As a dealer, I'll cuss them to high hell if they do without adding benefit.",t3_rqvwxm,1,wallstreetbets

Less than 10% of people actually click on a paid social ad and the *vast* majority of those are boomers. Basically nobody under 35 clicks on a paid social ad, since we don't trust anyone and don't want tracking. 

Great news for Facebook, since that's basically God's digital waiting room at this point. Bad news (in theory) for Reddit, where anyone who visits any politics sub can tell you that our userbase is young and knows fuck all about anything. 

However, I would far rather that 100,000 highly engaged retards know that Crayons Digest rates my purple as the world's most delicious, than have 10 people buy a pack of my scrumptious crayons. In part because young people know how to use Google properly, so I just optimise my website for ""I'm hungry need crayons"", ""Am retard what eat?"" or ""How to short GME"".

So I just use Reddit/paid social for awareness, organic social/search for acquisition.

I've really skimmed over it there but you get the point. My recent ads on Reddit got something like a 0.07 higher clickthrough rate than average.
