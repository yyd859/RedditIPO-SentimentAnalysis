1,I fucking love this sub. Hands down one of the best on Reddit,138,rt9yfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rt9yfi/i_fucking_love_this_sub_hands_down_one_of_the/,5,1641005975.0,"It's the best sub on Reddit, and potentially one of the only things keeping me on Reddit.

As soon as this sub and a few others are 'banned' on Reddit when this shitty social media IPOs, I'm leaving for a more secure Antiwork movement which I know for sure isn't going to stop anytime soon.

Thanks guys for making Reddit just that one small bit bearable for many of us!

We're doing great!"
2,Furious about Reddit IPO,72,rhkj2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rhkj2w/furious_about_reddit_ipo/,55,1639635830.0,"Iâ€™ve seen a lot of things that made me angry today but this has me enraged. Reddit is one of the last things we have thatâ€™s not just debt, hardship, and impossible rent, food and medical costs. These rich fucks donâ€™t like that weâ€™re organizing here so theyâ€™re making *us* the product. 

The corrupt system of trading shares of corporations that are *legally required* to profit, quarter after quarter, extracting linearly from a closed system *indefinitely* is literally an engine for extracting OUR LABOR as a resource.

4,Meet the Boss,8,rmjex8,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rmjex8/meet_the_boss/,4,1640220849.0,"When the news of the [Reddit IPO](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddit-ipo-alert-10-things-131534374.html) was announced, I became curious to know who owns Reddit, and I am passing along what I learned.

[Reddit's majority shareholder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit) is [Advance Publications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications). That company is owned by the Newhouse family, which is headed up by Donald Newhouse (pictured), who is worth $15.5 to 18.5 billion today, depending on whether you believe [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/profile/donald-newhouse/?sh=67d462bd1581) or [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/donald-e-newhouse/). Some of the early investors are listed in the Wikipedia article, and the later ones are listed on [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/reddit/company_financials).

The value of Reddit has skyrocketed during the last year. Revenue in Q2 was over [$100 million, a jump of 192%](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-secures-funding-to-continue-growth-plans/) from the year before. With their last round of funding, the company is now valued at at least $10 billion. At the beginning of the year, it was [valued at $6 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/reddits-valuation-doubles-to-6-billion-after-new-250-million-funding-round-.html).

Of course, Reddit's revenue and value come from advertising and selling user data. When the app is free, that means that you are the product. They need eyeballs on the app, and those eyeballs come almost entirely from content (like this post) and comments provided for free by unpaid users. The vast majority of the moderation work is also unpaid.

I think one could make an argument that getting out the message of r/antiwork is worth the trade, though some might disagree.  However, it seems to me that if you believe in the spirit of this subreddit, you should think about whether you want to post on subreddits that do not advance the agenda, like cooking, sports, and r/IdiotsInCars.

Frankly, I don't know what I am going to do. I don't use any other social media, but I have come to enjoy other communities on Reddit. I kind of feel like a sucker, though."
5,So with reddit about to go IPO where should we go once it starts banning subs like this one?,9,rhtat5,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rhtat5/so_with_reddit_about_to_go_ipo_where_should_we_go/,15,1639669198.0,"Some people have said we should try and buy they stocks ourselves, one person even made r/operationbuyreddit, I'm not from the US but seeing stuff like this gave me hope for tommorow, I don't want to see all of this just go up in smoke."

can people start making suggestions about good new place to rebuild? how about lemmy? i start started looking for alternatives. I just learned about the IPO."
7,Reddit IPO Concerns,5,rj8qjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rj8qjl/reddit_ipo_concerns/,3,1639838140.0,Iâ€™m worried about the upcoming reddit IPO. Among other concerns this may be a thinly vailed method of suppressing antiwork and the momentum weâ€™ve generated. How do we ensure the movement stays strong when reddit is trying to appease investors?
