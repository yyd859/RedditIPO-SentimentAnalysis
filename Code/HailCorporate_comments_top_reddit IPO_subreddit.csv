Again, the only reason private businesses exist is to make profits.  Whether the company is publicly owned or privately owned it makes no difference.  Koch Industries is one of the worst companies in the world and is privately owned.

Why do you think Advance Publications owns it now?  To make money is the answer.  The same reason they own all those TV channels and newspapers.

Public ownership might actually be better as users can now actually buy shares in the company and have some real control over the site.  Reddit has 430 million users, if everyone put up $20, they could control the whole company at the current valuation.
