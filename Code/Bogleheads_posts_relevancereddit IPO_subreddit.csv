Everyone be on your best behavior. Everyone with global market weights up front, preferably those with significant bond holdings as that community skews older and more risk averse. Those holding crypto and individual stocks in the back.


But seriously, welcome to anyone taking a look here who usually hangs out on the forum. I hope we can be as useful on Reddit as I have found the bogleheads forum to be all this time. Anyone unaware of the forum should take a look over there too. Lots of good discussion to be had."
