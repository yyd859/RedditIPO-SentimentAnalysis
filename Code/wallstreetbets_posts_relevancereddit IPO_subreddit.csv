Or do you think they’re relying on us pumping it. I personally don’t think I will because fuck them if they think they can use us as a tool. 
Monkey only fight for monkey

Plus with so many other good stocks basically for sale right now I’d rather be buying dips. 

On the other hand, Reddit pumping could create attention and bring more people to it thus creating a bigger pump. There’s a strong degen play here. Does anyone have a convincing argument that this could happen or is everyone in the same boat as me?"

A site so popular with so many users that it literally sold for a billion when a billion ACTUALLY was worth something

2013  Yahoo bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion

2019 Wordpress buys Tumblr for $3 million

Why?

Tumblr went down the path of banning explicit content, smut, bascially everything that was driving user growth. NSFW for everything bad, is a huge catalyst for users, activity and every single metric that matters.

Look at the fear that happened when Onlyfans decided they aren't a porn/sexworker place and wanted to go in another direction? Massive backlash and now they may not be able to go public.

Reddit has a huge base of NSFW activity, subreddits that discuss things that wouldn't fly anywhere else. While the CEO has said previously they aren't willing to ban porn and other objectionable content. That was before reddit goes public and suddenly becomes worth suing.

Imagine someone posts some revenge porn, or copy righted material, or someone follows DD and loses all their life savings investing in Silver derivatives. Sure reddit can say they police but that argument isn't helping instagram, facebook, pornhub. 

Reddit was too small to sue before. If reddit goes public I guarantee they will be worth suing there's going to be a ton of crack downs. 

Reddit would change for the worse. Users would leave. Ride the pump, puts immediately on options open"

I’ve been thinking a lot about the Reddit IPO - a few years ago I heard Shaq say that he doesn’t invest in companies he believes in, he invests in companies he USES…and that philosophy has worked out really well for him (especially his big Google purchase). 

With that shared, I’m thinking of making a big investment in Reddit. I think Reddit has the ability to go ALL the way. 

However, as a MEMBER and serious considering INVESTOR - here are my concerns (also happy to hear everyone else’s thoughts and concerns on this topic):

- When Reddit becomes an IPO is it subject to more oversight? One of the things that I love about Reddit is it’s open market style - from Wall Street Bets convos, to OnlyFans & prostitution channels, info on replica gear, and honest on anything we can imagine. Will that be lost? How might censorship play a role in Reddit becoming an IPO? Could that lead to the death of Reddit from a user perspective? Might users be required to reveal more of their private information? Will our data and conversations be sold or used against us? 

These are big picture concerns for me. If Reddit is able to survive as it does in this current moment, I think it has the opportunity to be HUGE and worth a Wall Streets Bets rally. 

What’s everyone else’s thoughts on this?"
5,"Why I am ""bullish"" on the Reddit IPO",17,rz6x09,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rz6x09/why_i_am_bullish_on_the_reddit_ipo/,45,1641667935.0,"Many people here point out that Reddit is not worth that much money as they will not make large profits. While I also think that Reddit is not a ""goldmine"" in an of itself this is not where the value comes from. Institutions typically buy news and media stocks like crazy. Institutional ownership of the New York times (NYT) for instance is currently above 93% which is ""typical"" for news companies.

[institutional ownership of the new York times https:\/\/money.cnn.com\/quote\/shareholders\/shareholders.html?symb=NYT&subView=institutional](https://preview.redd.it/jr1zuhbhcia81.jpg?width=634&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a1e43115369e64f51ca9671ddfd25497763572f)

Is this because the NYT or news companies in general are so profitable? Well, while the NYT made a profit of 65.1 million in the third quarter 2021, an increase of 15% from the same quarter one year ago, I do not think that this is the actual reason. Rather the true value comes from elsewhere. If you own it you can decide which articles are published, which topics are covered and have influence on the narrative. I.e. owning these companies allows you to push out news that positively affect stocks you are long on and negatively affect stocks you shorted. This is were their actual value for institutions comes from.

Or do you think stuff like this happens on coincidence?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6U2Un5kEdI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6U2Un5kEdI&t=14s)

Anyways, I think the same is true for Reddit. They already do this to some extent but owning the actual company will help to ""tighten"" their grip. There is a new fancy stock you want to pump and dump? Just push out some discussion on it on Reddit. You are short a stock and do not want people to FOMO in? selectively shadow ban mentions of this stock, change rules to keep rumors about it from spreading etc.

6,Reddit IPO Valuation,51,rkra3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rkra3v/reddit_ipo_valuation/,48,1640018158.0,"As you all know, Reddit has begun its process to file for an IPO. As we all use the platform and are most likely going to trade it, one way or the other, I see it prudent to open source this back of the napkin valuation to see what you autists think. 

**The Metrics**

Reddit, like all of the other social media platforms, primarily generates its revenue from ads. Thus, the KPIs we want to look at here are the MAUs and the average visit duration. Since, theoretically, the money from advertisers is going to flow to the company that has the most people coming to the platform and staying for the most amount of time. 

\*\*Since Snapchat doesn't give the MAU data, only the DAU, I just took the DAU and multiplied it by 2 lol. 

\*\*For any data that was missing, I normalized it by utilizing the respective company's MAU CAGR. 

MAU CAGR:

[I thought only moms used Pinterest](https://preview.redd.it/ba1o597f2q681.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=124bc03ae65ef95207544d62029d7ff7b0756a90)

MAU:

[Normalized by not including Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/szr9xkhsrp681.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=4258944ef27b8736c9c3db14798c2844c2150074)

Average Visit Duration:

[SNAP is assumed at 30 minutes](https://preview.redd.it/g7571g5wsp681.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9727504d3c00a71b60c0f12ee9ec880f84db9706)

Now, if we look at the 2026 MAUs, by using their MAU CAGR, and multiple the current average visit duration of each platform, we get the 2026 monthly average viewership. This metric is what ad sellers would most likely want to see.

2026 Monthly Average Viewership:

[In Minutes](https://preview.redd.it/ogxwigrovp681.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f4e0516518d532445067faec4ca43d4c9b62d38)

Here, we see Facebook as the clear platform winner, however, Reddit has continued to grow and has usurped Snapchat and Pinterest to become the #2 platform in monthly viewership. 

Now, with this \*information\* taken into consideration, the market is currently pricing these platforms at the following valuations:

**FB**: 903B

**TWTR**: 34B

**SNAP**: 72B

**PINS**: 23B

And I assign a value multiple comparing each platform's 2026 av. monthly viewership to Reddit's and then use that multiple to find the comparative market cap of Reddit. 

**FB**: -2.09 => 432B

**TWTR**: 1.86 => 63B

**SNAP**: 1.07 => 76B

**PINS**: 1.52 => 35B

Now, we have a range of Reddit comp valuations that I take the median of and slap a 40% safety of margin to because I know I am wrong. This returns a market valuation for Reddit of 50B. If we exclude Facebook from the list, we get a median return of 45B. For some reason, though, I think this is far too much and the likely range of valuation would be closer to 30B-45B.

All in all, Reddit is currently priced at $10B via its last series funding round. As we close in on the IPO date I suspect Reddit will begin to rapidly gain in valuation. Maybe we'll see it trade up to or even more than 45B. Who knows? I certainly do not have a clue. But as more info comes out I would like to see how off this valuation is. 

This sub has really shit on Reddit's IPO because you all think it'll follow with heavy censorship and/or monetization. If Reddit fucks with anything in that way it essentially destroys its platform. -that's all I'll say on that."

\* Reddit's market cap of $15 B is based off news reports and it could be higher or lower.

\*\* Meta is a combination of Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp

What is everyone thinking about this IPO. Clearly, monetization is an issue but you are also getting a steep discount per user so if they manage to increase monetization this might have some nice growth in it."

We all know what happened after once mighty Tumblr banned adult content - their user base evaporated by almost 50% practically overnight and they are no longer a household name. Even bringing back limited amounts of adult content didn’t help them. 

If Reddit pulls the same stunt, how long so you think that it will take their stock to tumble and what way would be the best way to capitalize on it?

Reddit was invented by young libertarian types but has slowly acquiesced to demands of the government and special interest groups. There is a long line of failed social media sires before Reddit came on the scene and Reddit’s technology could be easily replicated. 

I only see corporate board types and shareholders destroying the formula that makes Reddit special.
