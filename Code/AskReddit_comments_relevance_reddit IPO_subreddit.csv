Additionally, in r/askreddit there is a relentless wave of repetitive questions worded slightly differently.  How many questions do you want to entertain about super powers, what would you do with one day left to live, and what have you done that is cringeworthy?

I'm not thinking just of NSFW threads on Reddit, either. Reddit has a lot of lefty subreddits that are very active. r/antiwork and r/wallstreetbets have both attracted attention in mainstream media, and not the sort of attention that makes corporate types happy.

If Reddit attempts to purge its political, NSFW and generally controversial subreddits in the aim of ""not offending people"" well, I expect a mass exodus of the users that make this place fun.
