I think if SHFs are able to buy reddit and can somehow affect censorship of the GME subs, the most impactful move they can make will be to shut down communication about DRS. I believe this is our biggest threat. 

Everyone knows to buy and hold. Fewer people know, or are willing, to DRS without a lot more information to make that choice easier. If SHFs are able to exert control over these subreddits in any way, you can bet your jacked tits that DRS posts and conversations will be much more restricted or potentially banned. 

Cutting out our primary way of discussing/helping each other DRS will be extremely detrimental to our DRS efforts and I think we would slow down dramatically at that point. 

Locking the float will take months, so will this IPO. We're currently ahead in the race, but we shouldn't risk anything. If DRS makes sense to you, there's no time to waste. Don't give them the opportunity to implement whatever evil shit they're cooking up right now. 

Who gives a fuck about anything on this sub besides DRS and a marketplace launch announcement at this point. DRS is within our control and it can fuck them but we don't have unlimited time. 

**Go DRS so fucking hard** (if you want). Ok thanks I love you bye."

[\\""Talk is cheap, it takes money to buy whiskey\\"" - Ryan Cohen](https://preview.redd.it/msihkstty4581.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6cb6c06d26b3498ac6f8f9620a5984f79461876)

Ryan Cohen was the CEO of Chewy, an e-commerce company specializing in pets, which he founded when he was just 25 years old. In 2017, he sold Chewy to PetSmart in a $3.3 billion deal to pursue other personal goals.

Then Ryan Cohen's investor side began to gain notoriety. After selling Chewy, he invested his money in only two companies Apple and Wells Fargo. In Apple, he even became the largest single investor with about 6 million shares.

By the end of 2020, Cohen had also become GameStop's largest single shareholder after acquiring 10% of GME's stock and subsequently increasing his stake to about 13%. These investments were made before the extraordinary price explosion in GameStop stock in late January 2021. Shortly thereafter in April, he was named charmain of the board of directors. (Excerpt from [TheStreet article](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/gme/gamestop-stock-understanding-the-ryan-cohen-factor))

Ryan Cohen articulates his investment approach as follows:

>It's very hard, at least for me, to find great ideas. When I find something I'm really convinced of, I go all-in. (Excerpt from [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo))

However, when Ryan Cohen started Chewy in 2011, he was rejected by most investors....

>**Friedman:** You were rejected by 100 different investors. What did you learn from that process? What made you keep going when you kept hearing no?  
>  
>**Cohen:** To me, every no sounded like they just didn't understand my vision. That was frustrating at times, but never discouraging. Those ""no's"" never made me doubt my strategy - quite the opposite. All the rejections motivated me, and they only spurred me on. (Excerpt from [Forbes interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=5f5a6f355840))

He goes on to say that

>**Cohen:** Most investors couldn't overcome two hurdles: direct competition with Amazon and the failure of [pets.com](https://pets.com/) during the dot-com bubble. However, I believed that focusing on the pets category, along with highly personalized customer service, gave Chewy unique competitive advantages. [Pets.com](https://pets.com/) was a good idea, but a decade too early and not big enough to cover its costs. Those two hurdles didn't deter me. I never thought of changing my business plan. A highly respected venture capitalist once told me that he would be more interested if we sold live pets over the Internet rather than pet supplies. Like most investors, he thought it would be suicidal to get in Amazon's way. (Excerpt from [Forbes interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=5f5a6f355840))

How he managed to slam Amazon with Chewy anyway he tells here....

>**Cohen:** I focused on bringing a human element to e-commerce. We offered 24/7 customer service in the U.S. and relied on small touches like handwritten vacation cards and personalized pet portraits. This allowed us to connect with our customers and retain them for the long term by aiming for a lifelong relationship, not just a single order. In 2018, 90% of our sales came from repeat customers. The secret to Chewy was the relationship with customers. I realized that one big thought along the way was likely to be misunderstood. I'm a contrarian by nature (\*probably not the most appropriate term in current covid times), and when I'm misunderstood, it's often an affirmation of what I'm doing. It wasn't until Chewy boxes started appearing on front doors across the country that the majority of investors recognized our formula. (Excerpt from [Forbes interview](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=5f5a6f355840))

It's worth noting that [GameStop has the largest digital magazine subscription in the world with ""Game Informer""](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Informer) and 55 million PowerUp members are registered with GameStop. Someone like Ryan Cohen can capitalize on this by focusing on customer service and customer experience. You can tell he has a strong penchant for customer loyalty.

# Who Ryan Cohen is working with and how he took over GameStop

The following information comes from the really great[researched report](https://gmedd.com/opinion/who-is-ryan-cohen-working-with/) from [GMEdd.com](https://gmedd.com/). I provide you the report only a little bit modified here...

[Since a deal was struck between RC Ventures and GameStop in January 2021](https://gmedd.com/news/rc-ventures-agreement-reached/), Ryan Cohen has been working almost exclusively behind the scenes to transform the company, though it's not known who he consults with on strategic moves. By looking at Cohen's past and the footprints he's left behind, [GMEdd.com](https://gmedd.com/) is able to make a few educated guesses.

**Chewy's other co-founder**

[Blake’s LinkedIn shows that he was Co-Founder & CTO of Chewy until April 2018, ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbday/)[just a month after it was announced Ryan Cohen would be stepping down as CEO](https://miamiherald.typepad.com/the-starting-gate/2018/03/change-at-the-top-co-founder-ryan-cohen-stepping-down-as-ceo-of-chewy.html). Both Blake and Ryan remained with the company for a year after a [$3B payday from PetSmart in 2017](https://www.vox.com/2017/4/18/15339208/petsmart-chewy-acquisition-price-3-35-billion).

[From past interviews with Ryan Cohen](https://www.inc.com/emily-canal/petsmart-acquires-chewy.html), we know the founders first met through an online Java chat room and shared similar visions for a groundbreaking e-commerce business before starting Chewy.com together, but insight on Blake remains limited beyond this.

In a [TechCrunch interview in 2019](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-on-its-fast-approaching-ipo-its-like-seeing-my-baby-graduate/?guccounter=1), Ryan Cohen was asked,

>Would you partner again with Michael on a different e-commerce business or maybe a venture outfit?

to which Ryan Cohen responded,

>We’re really close. It needs to be the right opportunity obviously, and we need to be picky. But I have no plans to sit in retirement, that’s for sure. I’m 33 and I’m competitive and I like consumer businesses and I like to win.

Ryan is arguably in the midst of his **biggest venture yet**

Although Chewy's headquarters are in Florida, [the company built a small team in Boston](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/01/17/chewy-com-bounds-into-boston/6yYT83yX031PrXaQ0zXwBJ/story.html), initially working in temporary space before leasing its own 20,000-square-foot space in 2017. Cohen says Boston was an attractive location to recruit tech talent:

>Boston is a fantastic tech and startup hub with dozens of universities. There's just a lot of talent here. We looked at all the major U.S. cities when we were planning this office, and Boston was the most competitive. (Excerpted from [Boston Globe article](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/01/17/chewy-com-bounds-into-boston/6yYT83yX031PrXaQ0zXwBJ/story.html))

Blake Day, who served as CTO, led the Boston office. He gave an [interview to VentureFizz](https://venturefizz.com/stories/boston/engineering-spotlight-chewy) about the move to Boston, and you could tell he sounds a lot like Cohen:

https://preview.redd.it/dqvgmqfzy4581.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bda1517c09866f7b7899736004ca9ae62e6f1c6

Samantha Rassner served as Chewy’s Vice President of Software Development from September 2015 to February 2018. [In a LinkedIn blog post on her exit of the company, Samantha Rassner recounts Blake’s visionary speech](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-left-chewy-samantha-rassner/). Blake and Ryan sound one and the same here as well.

**Chewy's first investor**

[Larry Cheng, co-founder and managing partner of Volition Capital](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/members/larry-cheng/), was [the first major investor to back Chewy](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/portfolio/chewy/) after [the company was turned down numerous times by other firms.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/)

Larry’s investment through Volition was key to the growth and expansion of the company, and as a result, Larry and Ryan remain “fast friends.” While GameStop is a different story than Chewy,  it’s not crazy to think that Volition Capital and Larry Cheng have long been involved in mentoring the turnaround based on these facts alone.

https://preview.redd.it/70z29mc2z4581.png?width=462&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab9a270305ea0c185b67d006ad38cca09d3b394a

The timeline and Larry Cheng's seat on GameStop's board suggests **that Volition Capital and Larry Cheng are privy to Ryan's plans and have long been involved in supporting the turnaround**.

https://preview.redd.it/hsi6s7g3z4581.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=232497beeb6141957faec875761908548c13b988

[Ryan Cohen filed his first 13D for GameStop via RC Ventures LLC on August 28, 2020, disclosing an initial 9% stake](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822844/000101359420000670/rc13d-082820.htm). This sparked waves, particularly within value investor circles, as many pondered the E-commerce guru’s investment motives.

What few realize is that Cohen didn’t initially invest in August 2020, but much earlier in April 2019. This can be deduced from the [initial 13D](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822844/000101359420000670/rc13d-082820.htm), through share counts and averages based on implied price. [Rod Alzmann of GMEdd.com](https://gmedd.com/rod) states that when he inquired with GameStop last year, investor relations confirmed that Cohen had held $GME since April 2019.

Just one week after Ryan’s public disclosure, on September 4th, 2020, Volition Capital published an insight piece titled[ *Gaming as a Service and Why it Matters,*](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/gaming-as-a-service-and-why-it-matters/) authored by one of the firm’s associates, Claude de Jocas. This also appears to be the [first piece of gaming related research the firm has released.](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/gaming-as-a-service-and-why-it-matters/)

Over the next few weeks, [Ryan added to his position twice more until reaching a 9.98% stake, disclosed September 21](https://sec.report/Document/0001013594-20-000699/). Weeks later, on October 9, Volition released a video where Claude de Jocas discusses the[ future of internet gaming and its growth potential.](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/video-the-future-of-internet-gaming-with-claude-de-jocas/)

Skip ahead just one month, and on November 17, Ryan filed an amendment to his 13D [with an attached letter to the GameStop board urging the company to share a credible plan for seizing opportunities in the rapidly growing gaming sector.](https://gmedd.com/rc/ryan-cohen-urges-strategic-review-in-letter-to-the-board/)

**PR Blitz**

Ryan Cohen was far from being a household name in August of 2020 when he filed his initial stake in GameStop, so many investors started researching him to get a feel for what his plan was.[ At the time, Ryan had established a website, ryan-cohen.com, that embedded various media appearances and formal interviews the Chewy co-founder had given, but it has since been shut down in December of 2020.](https://web.archive.org/web/20201214000353/https://ryan-cohen.com/)

Had the website done its job? 

https://preview.redd.it/1e6tnz3fz4581.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2358e9f86124408e7a0d9ca53689dedac2e71bc

[Retail investing icon Roaring Kitty first stumbles upon Ryan Cohen’s rudimentary homepage during an August 28th, 2020 livestream.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Af9T8TU2OM?t=1950) At the time, the deep value investor was merely trying to learn more about the Chewy founder. Most of the content was posted on the site between mid-2019, around Chewy’s IPO and Cohen’s initial GameStop investment, and mid-2020.

Investors could speculate that this may have been [a coordinated PR blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_campaign) campaign [before revealing a large stake in a public company](https://gmedd.com/rc), one that he had already been discreetly acquiring.

Each interview Cohen conducted provided valuable insight into his business strategy, and much of how he described Chewy’s story and his vision could also be applied to GameStop. Was this intentional? [In one September 2019 post on Medium, when asked about what’s next, Ryan hinted at something being on the horizon](https://medium.com/authority-magazine/chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-we-put-together-a-team-that-was-obsessed-with-delighting-our-customers-e8cacbd0477b).

https://preview.redd.it/5jxbi2ihz4581.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=55f483e6a65f15b3ffdcaf6dcf2374b49cb8238a

>I\`m only 34, so i certainly haven\`t peaked as an entrepreneur yet. Stay tuned.

Okay, where were we? [Ryan Cohen started buying into GameStop in April of 2019, with a disclosure following increased holdings in August 2020.](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-gme-gamestop-rc-ventures-llc-sc-13d-2020-august-28-18503) It’s unknown as to when he made the decision and how much time was spent beforehand figuring out activist investor logistics coinciding with a PR blitz, **but it is reasonable to assume he was strategically building public-facing credibility for himself before revealing his high-stakes investment**.

Fast forward to 2021, [Ryan Cohen now owns 12.9% of GameStop](https://gmedd.com/rc/ryan-cohen-increases-stake/), joins the board, an extraordinary price explosion in late January generated national coverage of GameStop, prompting a series of [congressional hearings](https://gmedd.com/regulatory/gamestop-hearing-scheduled/), and suddenly everyone knows about [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/).

https://preview.redd.it/8keeaojiz4581.png?width=440&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5a6576010eb85df8adf46a1139676bddc8283c4

Amid all of this attention, the company remains quiet but starts undergoing rapid transformation, which was initially visible from the Investor Relations page, but now only seen through [activity on LinkedIn](https://gmedd.com/opinion/gamestop-poaches-talent-from-the-best/) — there have been over 30 new hires in tech and E-commerce positions starting in February, [just a month after Cohen joined the GameStop board.](https://gmedd.com/news/rc-ventures-agreement-reached/)

**Strategic Advisory**

[On March 2nd, 2021, Volition Capital launched a new Strategic Advisory Board](https://www.volitioncapital.com/news/volition-capital-launches-strategic-advisory-board-underscores-commitment-to-accelerate-portfolio-company-success/) that, “will provide focused guidance to the firm and its portfolio companies regarding strategic direction, investments, executive hiring and development, due-diligence, network and operational strategy, among other areas.” Volition states that the firm had been working on assembling this board for almost a year.

So a venture firm launched a strategic advisory board. Who cares?

[Wait, that name is familiar…](https://www.volitioncapital.com/strategic-advisory-board/#blake-day)

As of March 2021, Blake is now at the helm of Volition’s Strategic Advisory Board. Blake has l**argely laid low since his Chewy departure** and [still lives in Fort Lauderdale](https://gmedd.com/transformation/gamestop-hints-at-new-florida-office/) according to his Volition Capital bio.

This appears to be the first public role he has taken since leaving Chewy in 2018. ***Cohen*****cidence?**

Volition’s second listed Strategic Advisory Board Member is [Raul Fernandez, ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raul-fernandez-2877404)who serves as[ Vice Chairman and Owner of Monumental Sports & Entertainment](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raul-fernandez-2877404), which is a private partnership of Washington DC’s major sports franchises including eSports teams.

Early GameStop investors will recognize Raul’s name, because they will have seen it before as well.

GameStop claims that [Raul Fernandez was appointed to the board](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-raul-fernandez-and-lizabeth-dunn-board)  under an agreement with *Hestia Capital Partners, L.P.* (“Hestia Capital”) and *Permit Capital Enterprise Fund, L.P.*  (“Permit Capital”), lead by currently outgoing GameStop director and atypical shareholder activist [Kurt Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurt-wolf-b0a412b).

Hestia Capital and Permit Capital, together with their affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 1.3% of GameStop at this point, and Kurt Wolf, as their Managing Partner, had [just sent a letter to GameStop’s board calling for a corporate refresh.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hestia-capital-and-permit-capital-send-letter-to-gamestop-gme-board-of-directors-calling-for-a-refreshed-board-and-stock-tender-offer-of-up-to-700-million-300812140.html)

Wolf had been advocating for GameStop’s board to [adapt to the times and transform from an underperforming retailer into a forward-thinking company that emphasized long-term growth](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hestia-capital-and-permit-capital-send-letter-to-gamestop-gme-board-of-directors-calling-for-a-refreshed-board-and-stock-tender-offer-of-up-to-700-million-300812140.html). He later insists in a May 2020 presentation by Restore that Raul be placed to GameStop's board of directors.

While the GameStop board claimed they began to cooperate with Hestia/Permit in April of 2019, [Ryan Cohen](http://twitter.com/ryancohen) began purchasing his initial position in the gaming retailer.

Fernandez still currently serves on GameStop’s board, and [filings reveal he will be stepping down at the Annual General Meeting on June 9th, ](https://gmedd.com/news/rc-ventures-on-pace-to-control-gamestop-board/)as Ryan Cohen takes the reigns as incoming Chairman of the Board. 

# GameStop's transformation to a technology company

A lot has happened in the nearly 10 months so far since Ryan Cohen was appointed to GameStop's board in February 2021, and it's clear that the transformation is in full swing:

* [GameStop executed two ATM offerings, flushing another $1.7 billion into the company's transformation cash](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-completes-market-equity-offering-program-0)

* [Total of 322 new hires since February](https://gmedd.com/report-model/) for e-commerce, UI, UX, blockchain, operations and supply chain, including 200+ senior management hires coming from leading tech companies. Most of the new hires are from Chewy, Amazon, and Zulily. (It's worth noting that many of the new hires are talking about a one-time opportunity, and even the senior director of Apple Care, who worked there for 10-years, is moving to GameStop. Management also heavily promotes just about everything on LinkedIn)

# Conclusion

You can see that RC really believes in what he is doing. It's a mentality like this why some people say ""invest in the man, not the company"". And I think that saying fits. I have faith in Ryan Cohen! This guy fucks! Similarly with someone like Elon Musk. I don't want to put anyone on a pedestal, but a lot of investors put a lot of blind faith in him because they believe in his vision. It's great when you can combine a great company with a visionary at the helm. That's the cherry on top of a solid investment.

Here's some more fundamental analysis on this....

* ""GameStop is neither an ordinary stock nor a failing retail chain, as Wall Street previously thought.""

Furthermore, [since June 23, 2021, not a single insider with more information than anyone else has sold their shares](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1326380.htm). And that was just one person selling since January.

GameStop is the world's largest retailer of video games. With Ryan Cohen as its new chairman and a new, technology-focused board, the company now has unified leadership dedicated to two long-term goals: **""delighting customers and creating value for shareholders.""** 2021 was a watershed year for GameStop, with a strengthened and consolidated financial position ([$1.4 billion cash on hand in Q3](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-financial-results-q3-2021)) and rapidly increasing net sales ([29% growth in Q3](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-financial-results-q3-2021)), the transformation is also well underway.

In addition, GameStop has made a **radical strategic shift**, **expanding its business model** to compete and thrive in the age of mobile gaming and digital downloads, and reinvented itself as a major e-commerce player. Gamestop already has **4,816 stores in 14 countries and over 55 million PowerUp members**. As it continues to develop its e-commerce business and build a mass-market NFT marketplace, the long-term potential of this company is truly great.

And so regardless of the hotly debated MOASS theory, GameStop is an undervalued stock for me to invest in long-term. And I have my shares registered directly in my name (DRS) with Computershare because I hate synthetic/naked shares.

2,Reddit IS becoming Public and what this may mean?,11,rhslsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/rhslsu/reddit_is_becoming_public_and_what_this_may_mean/,4,1639667176.0,"We've probably all seen the news right now that Reddit is listing for an IPO this will mean publicity and shareholders to answer too, most importantly these shareholders may possibly be hedgefunds and MM's who have tried to use the platform to twist there narrative. 

BE PREPARED, there may be a time that reddit is no longer safe, that the subreddits are taken down, that we see large FUD and shill attacks as in there best interests

TRUST THE DD, know your DD and the sources to find it in the event of a reddit outtage or severe censorship, read it, internalise it, and trust it, like a compass during a storm your instincts will work against you.

BE DUMB MONEY, That's what they called me and maybe you and you and you in the back, don't be logical be the idiosyncratic risk you want to see in the market, 

Thanks everyone for listening GME"

We NEED a backup sub for superstonk,0,rhlq5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/rhlq5q/former_the_donald_user_we_need_a_backup_sub_for/,12,1639640527.0,"Politics aside, I am a former the\_donald user. The sub has been through a lot and eventually had to move to it's own alternative website. I am not advocating the\_donald in any way. I am trying to make people aware that we should be ready for r/superstonk to be banned at any point. It would be best to have our own website already set up in case of an event such as this. With talk of reddit launching their own IPO, I think anything is possible in the realm of GME."
