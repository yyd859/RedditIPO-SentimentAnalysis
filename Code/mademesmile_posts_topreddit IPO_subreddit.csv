Someone gifted me Reddit gold and that means I can enjoy scrolling with no alcohol ads through the holidays.

I’m just a normal fucking alcoholic in recovery and I wanted to express my gratitude and share what has made me smile today. The value that I mentioned in the post title is of the unquantifiable, intangible variety and has nothing to do with money. I really wish you the best of luck in your journeys.

This is typical “‘For every award, that's a minute I wont drink’ good job trash king.” What’s going on with y’all that you feel the need to be like this? I opened up and made myself vulnerable here. I don’t understand this response."
