7,hp6r09a,t3_rjy5rc,"Incredible analysis!

About the only thing I would disagree with is the scale of the war (i.e. 50 million guerillas), but it'd still be catastrophic. I would put the number at a million at most, because I think it's a good midpoint between my low end and high-end numbers.

My basic disagreement comes from methodology; you're looking at firearm ownership in general, while I'd prefer to look at pre-existing militia groups. I believe militia membership is a far better predictor because it shows us which people are *already* open about the idea of using violence to achieve their political goals if it came to it. Obviously, far more people would join the fray and create new groups if fighting starts, but I believe looking at armed groups that already exist is the best baseline, because they've already spent years ""psyching themselves up"" for something like this.

Either way, my reasoning is that at any given moment there are around 150-200 militia groups in the US. Some groups are larger and some are smaller, but let's assume an average of around battalion-strength (i.e. 300 people). That would give us a core of around 60,000 people, and our low end.

For our high end, that would be 10-11 million people, or about 3% of the total US population. I say this because I study conflicts and it seems that only a single-digit percentage of people generally join the fighting. Even at the height of WW2, in a state of total war, with vast government powers to conscript and train as many people as needed, only about 9% of the US was mobilized.

The same pattern holds true for irregular conflicts. Afghanistan has almost 39 million people and Iraq 40 million, but the US military didn't face millions of insurgents swarming their tens of thousands of troops. Certainly, there were millions of passive supporters of the insurgency(i.e. people who agree with an insurgency even if they don't do anything to help it along), but the amount of people willing to actually pick up a gun and take shots is relatively low even among a hostile populace.",t3_rjy5rc,84,collapse

18,hp9cnc6,t3_rjy5rc,"Excellent post, this is the content r/collapse produces at its best. A few points:

* Only 1% or less of the population will fight. This tracks with civil conflicts like the Ulster troubles. Of course in USA that's 3+ million people.

* Our military leadership sucks. They have an overblown sense of their own strength, they can't beat guerilla forces anywhere, and they are enormously corrupt. We should expect that they will act reactively and stupidly to provocations.

* There are no militarized ideologically 'left' centers of violence. The right wing will completely own the guerilla theater, and have a much larger base of support than any 'left' or traditionally liberal faction. The liberals will be the largest faction and will be totally reliant on a failing state to help them.

* Our elites and politicians are mostly weak fools and I expect many of them to be captured or killed by insurgents easily if this thing pops off. There is a middling-millionaire gentry that will fund and support the rightist insurgency in these scenarios. The big bourgeoisie will not be able to hold things together, and they have thrown in completely with the corrupt and mushy liberal center that cannot last.

* 'Foreign propaganda' is often overblown. The USA is killing itself just fine without too much interference. Putin and Xi just met and essentially signalled a new Eurasian military alliance and economic sphere. It is no accident that the Russians immediately released a list of *demands* to NATO for the first time since the dissolution of the USSR. The Russians and PRC can now deal with the west from a position of assurance and strength. They will act according to those demands, which are: back away from our borders, leave us alone, or else. Of course their intel agencies are acting to disrupt things here, but a full blown *collapse* of USA power isn't in their interest. They want a managed retreat of the Imperial forces so that no batshit homicidal Yankee decides to end all life on Earth while this all goes down. In that, I'm decidedly on their side.

A military isn't just a bunch of guys with guns. Where do they muster? What is their command structure? Where are their bullet factories? How will they communicate? Store bought walkie-talkies aren't encrypted or appropriate for war. How many are fit to serve and trained? Most people have never been in the military and 40% of the country is obese.

Thanks for a well laid out interesting Post

Do have questions though...I lived overseas in Thailand and a while in Philippines both countries have long term instability issues, Thailand alone has had 22 military coup in 80 years and dozens of failed constitutions..also both countries in some ways has used marital law at periodic times to sometimes no success. 

Wondering based on your insight which seems to be pretty wide viewed world wise if you could see the USA just having long term instability issues or just years of bouts of instability not necessarily a full blown civil war namely

 failed elections
Occasionally assassinations
- Insurgency groups created due to idiotic failed attempts at handling situations that got people unnecessary killed which pissed off locals, friends, family etc creating a insurgency
- off and on using martial law
- essentially having the US military in charge of everything including military basically being president and everything else
- militant groups would be likely to setup check points, 

Also as for the 50 million insurgency I could see it happening and maybe this is just me

Honestly people don't take kindly to there friends, family, loved ones getting killed off, don't underestimate the power of wanting revenge, also insurgency group would also be likely as it's basically not realistic that the state, city officials can maintain security. 

As for corporations and power if being realistic, look from financial news most have spent the last few years and even now only doing mostly stock buybacks there not really investing in anything substantial. to be honest I wouldn't be either 

also don't forget corporations are about money and power, let's assume trump takes control, if he can successful take over enough areas he could get corporations to do basically anything other wise he could just use any number of options to get them closed, taken over, massive Trump supporter backlash, it's not really hard to envision any number of things to be used against a corporation that isn't being Trump friendly

Also while this sounds messed up how quickly do you think corporate executives will sign up to support anything if there family suddenly gets kidnapped, or a outspoken executive gets assassinated, or people just suddenly disappearing.",t3_rjy5rc,2,collapse

He then lost the election and claimed, along with his lawyers and others, to have a mountain of evidence of widespread election fraud, he then lost 67 court cases in a row, often in front of judges he had hand picked himself, never showing a single scrap of evidence of this ridiculous claim of widespread election fraud.

It got so bad that highly respected cyber security expert Christopher Krebs, who ran CISA at the time, began running a website to debunk Trump's fascist election fraud lies, and then Trump found out about it and fired him(along so, so many other important people that the public is unaware of).

Then after January 6th Republicans literally stripped Liz Cheney of her committee seats and power in Congress because she refused to go along with the lie that Trump won the election. Months and months after the election. 

This is a crystsl clear signal that Republicans are interested in rules by force, not democracy - the entire party including the heads are illegitimizing our elections and undermining our democracy by pretending the election was not secure, and that it was stolen. This is so unbelievable just on its own that I'm shocked every day but people aren't up in arms about this.

Now I don't mean to say that can't happen but there is a reason for that.  Revolution on a large scale typically comes from those that feel that don't have much to loose.  We live in a nation where we go to the grocery store for food, freakout when gas prices go up, manufacturing is in large part over seas (although we do have a decent amount here).  While people care about their family's and will want to protect them that doesn't just include violent action but also food security, maintaining in anyway they can their standard of living.  

Two you seem to have framed this as if it would be most of the civilian population vs the military.  Keep in mind that mostly like there would be different ""safe areas"" for different factions.  Different military factions will have safe areas that have sympathetic civilian populations that they can launch operations from and try and form logistic lines in.  No gorilla warfare is very effective but not universally effective but keep a few things in mind.  Civilians will not have a effective way to take on the navy and its own air force.  Nuclear powered carriers that can supply at safe harbors, foreign ports, have defense system and escorts that would make civilian approach impossible.  Now we can maybe the navy would fracture but then whatever faction of the navy comes out on top is in the same position as the whole navy was before.  

Three I think it would be interesting if we looked at the geography of the US although for this I don't have a specific point to make but rather somethings I think should be kept in mind.  The west is extremely vulnerable due to water shortages.  A few bombs on some dams and millions are without water with no real way to supply them with water outside of massive transportation networks to transport bottled water that likely still wouldn't work.  
Large amounts of produce are located in California.  
The plain states.  Large swaths of agriculture on flat open ground.  This is a very important area because of the rivers that run through those areas and the crops produced there.  Flat open ground does not make fighting government forces easy.  Tanks, armored vehicles, aircraft and so on will be in their element in lands like this.

If we could find a way to facilitate peace talks between the leaders of disparate militias and thus bolster their power, we may actually be able to shift the balance of power in this country between political constituents and politicians.

- isis has been nearly defeated (in syria, anyways) because just about everybody and their grandmother were fighting against them. nato, russia, iran, iraq, syria, the rebels, and even other islamic extremists were all fighting against them - there wasn't anyone actively arming them besides western weapons manufacturers, and even then most of their arms had been taken from former us military bases in iraq. keep in mind that they still managed to control huge swaths of territories and spread out into both africa and afghanistan, as well as cause a shitload of damage. also - *syria isn't a guerilla war.*
- kurdistan is still actively fighting after several years

It will start, and possibly end the way Nazi Germany did.  First there were revolutionary communists who took a government building and started a revolt, then there were the far right reactionaries who reacted to places like the Soviet Republic of Munich by killing a thousand civilians and protesters, those were the antecedents to the SA, the Freikorps (essentially ""freedom militia"" in German).  Then you will have a continuation of this far right reactionism before you have the camps built up and then the possible execution of those prisoners.  That's the doomsday scenario and not at all impossible, the world already watched it happen once and did nothing about it until they had their military forces guilty up and they became more extremely violent.  I would say the German's went through it first, that type of reaction between right and left, but there have always been reactionaries to descending states, like Rome.  You have to kill someone who wants to abolish debt or who wants to give up on the military industrial complex.  The aristocrats were still in control of Nazi Germany even if they did tentatively fear Hitler, he loved them.  He thought of them as his friends, and they thought of him as unstable, look at what Elon Musk said about the abortion ban in Texas to get an idea of the way a rich industrialist will behave.  He probably thinks they are unstable to, they caught him on camera shaking Trumps hand, he doesn't care, and the rich industrialists never cared when an unstable person came to power unless he was a communist.  As long as that person is on their side, they will be allowed to live with that instability, because they are not connected to everyone's reality and they barely have been.  German factory worker's days got worse after the rise of power in Hitler, but they still voted him in.  I guessing the industrialists were and to make a certain amount of profit in that time, because they were all using slave labour, that's what those people in the camps were for.  It was a ""Golden Age"" in German history according to a lot of the interviews that were taken of German's after the war.  Even after the war, Hitler was still regarded as the hero, and the German's were only mad that they lost.  It doesn't mean that everyone believed in the cause, but if there are enough people that do believe, you will either be forced to go along with it or end up in jail.  The only difference is that there is no one to bail us out from this one.  There will just be multiple state actors watching from afar, only, unlike Germany, we're not bankrupt and powerless to control our economy, at least our politicians aren't, there was no major war debt on us, the rest of the world looked at our economy and rightfully thought that we were/are the richest, because we still are.  Germany had a lot of technological innovation, but was completely bankrupt.  We'll collapse like the Soviet State, only instead of becoming authoritarian communist, we will just become more fascist as we go along, and I truly think that's the darker path.
