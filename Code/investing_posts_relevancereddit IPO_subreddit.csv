0,Becoming an Accredited Investor via becoming a Registered Independent Investment Advisor,42,rye43o,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/rye43o/becoming_an_accredited_investor_via_becoming_a/,57,1641579901.0,"So i'm planning on passing the Series 65 and then registering with my state as an independent investment advisor in order to become an accredited investor.   


has anyone on here done this?? i know i don't need a sponsoring broker (Texas), but i know i need to register. i'm just confused about all the red tape really. i've studied on my own for so long, i'm not too worried about the test. There's some stuff (warrants, convertibles, etc) i'm gonna have to digest slowly but most of it shouldn't be too bad.   


any help would be much appreciated! excited to get this knocked out this year! hopefully i'll be looking at syndication PPMs by the 4th quarter.... haha."
