We all know what happened after once mighty Tumblr banned adult content - their user base evaporated by almost 50% practically overnight and they are no longer a household name. Even bringing back limited amounts of adult content didn‚Äôt help them. 

If Reddit pulls the same stunt, how long so you think that it will take their stock to tumble and what way would be the best way to capitalize on it?

Reddit was invented by young libertarian types but has slowly acquiesced to demands of the government and special interest groups. There is a long line of failed social media sires before Reddit came on the scene and Reddit‚Äôs technology could be easily replicated. 

I only see corporate board types and shareholders destroying the formula that makes Reddit special.

A site so popular with so many users that it literally sold for a billion when a billion ACTUALLY was worth something

2013  Yahoo bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion

2019 Wordpress buys Tumblr for $3 million

Why?

Tumblr went down the path of banning explicit content, smut, bascially everything that was driving user growth. NSFW for everything bad, is a huge catalyst for users, activity and every single metric that matters.

Look at the fear that happened when Onlyfans decided they aren't a porn/sexworker place and wanted to go in another direction? Massive backlash and now they may not be able to go public.

Reddit has a huge base of NSFW activity, subreddits that discuss things that wouldn't fly anywhere else. While the CEO has said previously they aren't willing to ban porn and other objectionable content. That was before reddit goes public and suddenly becomes worth suing.

Imagine someone posts some revenge porn, or copy righted material, or someone follows DD and loses all their life savings investing in Silver derivatives. Sure reddit can say they police but that argument isn't helping instagram, facebook, pornhub. 

Reddit was too small to sue before. If reddit goes public I guarantee they will be worth suing there's going to be a ton of crack downs.

11,Reddit IPO Valuation,52,rkra3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rkra3v/reddit_ipo_valuation/,48,1640018158.0,"As you all know, Reddit has begun its process to file for an IPO. As we all use the platform and are most likely going to trade it, one way or the other, I see it prudent to open source this back of the napkin valuation to see what you autists think. 

**The Metrics**

Reddit, like all of the other social media platforms, primarily generates its revenue from ads. Thus, the KPIs we want to look at here are the MAUs and the average visit duration. Since, theoretically, the money from advertisers is going to flow to the company that has the most people coming to the platform and staying for the most amount of time. 

\*\*Since Snapchat doesn't give the MAU data, only the DAU, I just took the DAU and multiplied it by 2 lol. 

\*\*For any data that was missing, I normalized it by utilizing the respective company's MAU CAGR. 

MAU CAGR:

[I thought only moms used Pinterest](https://preview.redd.it/ba1o597f2q681.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=124bc03ae65ef95207544d62029d7ff7b0756a90)

MAU:

[Normalized by not including Facebook](https://preview.redd.it/szr9xkhsrp681.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=4258944ef27b8736c9c3db14798c2844c2150074)

Average Visit Duration:

[SNAP is assumed at 30 minutes](https://preview.redd.it/g7571g5wsp681.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9727504d3c00a71b60c0f12ee9ec880f84db9706)

Now, if we look at the 2026 MAUs, by using their MAU CAGR, and multiple the current average visit duration of each platform, we get the 2026 monthly average viewership. This metric is what ad sellers would most likely want to see.

2026 Monthly Average Viewership:

[In Minutes](https://preview.redd.it/ogxwigrovp681.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f4e0516518d532445067faec4ca43d4c9b62d38)

Here, we see Facebook as the clear platform winner, however, Reddit has continued to grow and has usurped Snapchat and Pinterest to become the #2 platform in monthly viewership. 

Now, with this \*information\* taken into consideration, the market is currently pricing these platforms at the following valuations:

**FB**: 903B

**TWTR**: 34B

**SNAP**: 72B

**PINS**: 23B

And I assign a value multiple comparing each platform's 2026 av. monthly viewership to Reddit's and then use that multiple to find the comparative market cap of Reddit. 

**FB**: -2.09 => 432B

**TWTR**: 1.86 => 63B

**SNAP**: 1.07 => 76B

**PINS**: 1.52 => 35B

Now, we have a range of Reddit comp valuations that I take the median of and slap a 40% safety of margin to because I know I am wrong. This returns a market valuation for Reddit of 50B. If we exclude Facebook from the list, we get a median return of 45B. For some reason, though, I think this is far too much and the likely range of valuation would be closer to 30B-45B.

All in all, Reddit is currently priced at $10B via its last series funding round. As we close in on the IPO date I suspect Reddit will begin to rapidly gain in valuation. Maybe we'll see it trade up to or even more than 45B. Who knows? I certainly do not have a clue. But as more info comes out I would like to see how off this valuation is. 

This sub has really shit on Reddit's IPO because you all think it'll follow with heavy censorship and/or monetization. If Reddit fucks with anything in that way it essentially destroys its platform. -that's all I'll say on that."
12,Thoughts on the Reddit IPO/Stock?,63,rt485p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rt485p/thoughts_on_the_reddit_ipostock/,104,1640987602.0,"Hey everyone‚Äîtwo year Reddit premium member and frequent big loser on Wall Street bets. I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about the Reddit IPO - a few years ago I heard Shaq say that he doesn‚Äôt invest in companies he believes in, he invests in companies he USES‚Ä¶and that philosophy has worked out really well for him (especially his big Google purchase). 

With that shared, I‚Äôm thinking of making a big investment in Reddit. I think Reddit has the ability to go ALL the way. 

However, as a MEMBER and serious considering INVESTOR - here are my concerns (also happy to hear everyone else‚Äôs thoughts and concerns on this topic):

- When Reddit becomes an IPO is it subject to more oversight? One of the things that I love about Reddit is it‚Äôs open market style - from Wall Street Bets convos, to OnlyFans & prostitution channels, info on replica gear, and honest on anything we can imagine. Will that be lost? How might censorship play a role in Reddit becoming an IPO? Could that lead to the death of Reddit from a user perspective? Might users be required to reveal more of their private information? Will our data and conversations be sold or used against us? 

These are big picture concerns for me. If Reddit is able to survive as it does in this current moment, I think it has the opportunity to be HUGE and worth a Wall Streets Bets rally. 

What‚Äôs everyone else‚Äôs thoughts on this?"

**$ABCL is making for Eli Lily that Ly-Cov1404 antibody that can kill Omicron. You can watch the video on CBC twit:**

[https://twitter.com/CNBCClosingBell/status/1471234088816230407](https://twitter.com/CNBCClosingBell/status/1471234088816230407)

**Funny thing is that I was unware of this development when I was writing.**

**That is big news but I suggest reading forward to see $ABCL value beyond Covid.**

*I also shorted the personal views of life part.No time for that.*

So, as this new guy arround Omicy is doing some more damage, the Covid investing theme has been revamped like an old pleasure worker, getting some charm again.

**We all know the trick: get a winner that might make some nice and fa(s)t gains if it hits gold BUT in the same time to make sure that with out this particular opportunity, it has a bigger value than the one assesed by the market.**

Now many things happened in 2020 also in tech, energy, etc but biotech was hot on pandemic and to elimnate the need to research some other field, I only focused on biotechs.

1. So I browsed and I shuffled eliminating first the ones that are already flying high on Covid fears. Easy money are already made there. No time for that.
2. Then I eliminated the stocks that had debt, like 0 ZERO debt. The rate hike is in the cards and will make  refinancing or repaying that debt harder. No time for that.
3. Further I eliminated (againt my feelings) all the de-spacs. That trend has its own highs and downs and is  you know... keep it simple. Small caps, easy to manipulate stocks - dumped as well.

**And then I started to dig deep in the pipelines of the few left on the table. Some pretty good names there, a lot to read but  $ABCL Abcellera stood right there.**

To be honest I owned some already (bc of Peter Thiel) but my selection was ownership blind. Just going for the target.

Very short backgroudn story - Abcellera become worldwide famous in 2020 as they were the first company on the planet to get EUA for their antibody treatment. After the IPO ABCL surged as high as 70s and now stands at $13.5. They made some nice hundres of millions until now from that antibody but got crushed when vaccines rolled out, got facny again on variant D as their antibody works great on that and it seems they have a new antibody that can kill Omicron too. (see the update in the top of the page). 

**But**, **You know why $ABCL is great?**

**ABCL pipeline has 150 programs and 131 are royalty based. All those 131 programs have nothing to do with Covid. Nothing.**

**What that means is that from any of this 131 programs they stand to win some 5% (source- management)  of the sales.**

**How much is that?**

I googled it - laisy bastard sometimes and I actualy found a guy (but reddit won't let me place a link here) that actually did that math for me:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2lskkywl6y581.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ee4fb675f7c1cbc89f0986419d0d45f77be9e3

They have some 700M cash in hand right now and stand to earn some more this quarter as they deliver more antbody and they didn't shown any tendency o dillute stock holders (I'll dig deep in to that later).

Now, 25% success rate seemed too high for my taste (you know lowest risk, right?)

ABCL has a 25+% success rate but the industry average is 15%. I wanted to make the math for an industry average.

This time is much easier: 15 out of 25 is something like 60%. 60% out of 41$ is 24$.

**Even if ABCL would be an average biotech - with this number of programs, the real value of $ABCL would be 24$. Right now if not 1$ would be earned from their covid antibody. Also NO growth rate has been factored in. Like they would not sign another customer in the next decade.**

But, wait (if you're not bored already) and let's seee just how average is ABCL. Who knows, maybe they are under average or not.

**In short about ABCL**

ABCL owns a global database of different antibodies, from humans and lot of species. On top of that full stakc they use AI to identify the best candidate that can kills a bacteria, virus or cancer and that candidate gets cloned, mutiplied and delivered to the pacient.

Spunds like a great idea but are they really good at doing that? Let's see.

**Who's vetting for ABCL**

I am not that smart to judge on scientifical merrits, but I know who's hat smart - big pharma. Seeing who's working with them and actually pays them, can give a clue on how serious are they.

Here is the short list (the ones that I recognized) of partners of ABCL that are also paying for their platform/research right now. Also this guys are responsible for that 131 programs with royalties:

EliLily\*, Sanofi, GSK\*, Novartis, Bill&Melinda Gates, Gilead, Pfizer, Kodiak, Merck, Regeneron\* and very recently Moderna. It is hard to name a big pharma that is not there.

\*Also you might notice among the biotechs using their platform are all the Covid antibody competition.

Each one of those are ordering more programs and many others are joining them quarter by quarter.

Here is the growth rate focusing on programs ony:

***Q2*** ***Total programs under contract of 138, up 82% from Q2 2020***

***Q3 2021- Total programs under contract of 155 adding 17 new programs.***

[***https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/abcellera-biologics-inc-abcl-q3-2021-earnings-call/***](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/abcellera-biologics-inc-abcl-q3-2021-earnings-call/)

Who else is backing them? O**h, the Canadian Goverment gave them already some 176M.** Some 50M were for the Covid treatment development but 125M was given to build a nice cool factory.

They are building right now a GMP protein biologic manufacturing area and the building will feature laboratory, offices and warehouse space.

[https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/projects/abcellera-biologics-vancouver-facility/](https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/projects/abcellera-biologics-vancouver-facility/)

And my favorite early investor (innitial backer)  and member of the board of Abcellera - **Peter Thiel (PLTR, LAZR, ASANA).**

But, hey, if you don;t know who's Peter Thiel ... this is not the place to learn but you should really find time and google it.

**Conclusion**

I already got tired of writing and you got bored with my story.

**Here is the deal :**

* **ABCL IPO price was 20$ (with only some 80 programs and factory paid by Canadian goverment),**
* **ABCL target price (6 analysts median) is 46$**
* **ABCL in my conservative, NO COVID valuation, sets the price at 24$.**
* **Right now you can buy it with 13.5.**

Now, if Covid will stay arround they will make a lot more money like really a lot.

They also have under clinical test a new antibody LY-CoV1404 or Bebtelovimab. As of September 2021 NIH was saying that it can kill ALL Covid variants. IT seems that atacks that protein that don't mutate.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8109210/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8109210/)

Who knows? Untill FDA says otherwise, we need to see this.

Right now the risks on the table are like this:

Scenario 1: If ABCL puts on the table a proven Omicron killer, the stock will rally and we will never see it at 13.5 again.

Scenario 2: If ABCL gets more contracts with the same or other big guys, or if they publish some positive data from any of those 131 programs, it will rally as their business model will get more and more visibility. Chance are that maybe you can get it again at this price or not.

Scenario 3: If ABCL stops selling Covid antobodies and stop signing new contracts, it will keep develop new drugs and slowlly rise to 24$

Scenario 4: IF ABCL suddenly stops delivering results, gets contracts cancelled and they prove to be a ponzi scheme - we all loose our money and will be proved stupid along Peter Thiel, all the Canadian Gov. (not sure there:) Bill Gates, Pfizer, Sanofi, Gilead, GSK and you get the idea :D.

**Please read this with Russel Brand voice:**

That is what I think but more imortantly is what YOU think. Let me know in the comments.

While I also think that Reddit is not a ""goldmine"" in an of itself this is not where the value comes from. Institutions typically buy news and media stocks like crazy. Institutional ownership of the New York times (NYT) for instance is currently above 93% which is ""typical"" for news companies.

[institutional ownership of the new York times https:\/\/money.cnn.com\/quote\/shareholders\/shareholders.html?symb=NYT&subView=institutional](https://preview.redd.it/jr1zuhbhcia81.jpg?width=634&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a1e43115369e64f51ca9671ddfd25497763572f)

Is this because the NYT or news companies in general are so profitable? Well, while the NYT made a profit of 65.1 million in the third quarter 2021, an increase of 15% from the same quarter one year ago, I do not think that this is the actual reason. Rather the true value comes from elsewhere. If you own it you can decide which articles are published, which topics are covered and have influence on the narrative. I.e. owning these companies allows you to push out news that positively affect stocks you are long on and negatively affect stocks you shorted. This is were their actual value for institutions comes from.

Or do you think stuff like this happens on coincidence?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6U2Un5kEdI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6U2Un5kEdI&t=14s)

Anyways, I think the same is true for Reddit. They already do this to some extent but owning the actual company will help to ""tighten"" their grip. There is a new fancy stock you want to pump and dump? Just push out some discussion on it on Reddit. You are short a stock and do not want people to FOMO in? selectively shadow ban mentions of this stock, change rules to keep rumors about it from spreading etc.

The reasons I like the stock then (very fast growth in users + ARPU) as well as the long-term durability of a business that comes attached to a several hundred dollar device (heavy, not something you move in a whim) still apply. The recent drops make me more bullish on the company than I have ever been. 

## **The Company**

ROKU is a profitable, fast-growing advertising technology company (like Facebook, Twitter, or Google) that sells television devices as well as software that runs on those devices. Founded in 2002, it is even older than Facebook and Twitter, but didn't IPO until 2017. 

The profitability growth experienced by ROKU since its IPO has been phenomenal -- the vast majority of the stock's performance comes from the performance in its financials, rather than to multiple expansion. ROKU IPO-d at 10x gross profit and now trades at about 20x gross profit -- while gross profit increasing about 7x over the same timeframe. Last quarter, ROKU clocked a 70% YoY increase in gross profit -- the flywheel is still moving at an incalculable rate.

Sales growth has been more modest, remaining in the 50%-60% range but gross profit growth is more reflective of the strength of the business, as ROKU's revenue lumps together one minimally unprofitable + moderate growth business (sales of players) with a highly profitable + fast growing one (sales of targeted ads + other platform fees). 

It's surprising to consider that ROKU is still growing its top line about as quickly as when it IPO-d, but mathematically, this is because small declines in platform growth rate have been offset by the business as a whole increasingly reflecting this faster growing segment. As the platform business is now around 75%-80% of the business, future revenue growth will increasingly reflect platform growth, not player growth. Hence, this shift in mix toward the faster-growing business should continue to act as a tailwind for the company's relative financial performance, even as the growth from this business itself slows over time.

To make a long story short, ROKU's top-line growth is not likely to slow down in the coming years, as both this minor tailwind and minor headwind should be anticipated to roughly offset one another for years to come. Consistent growth at 50%+ for any non-negligible amount of time leads to big numbers, quick.

## **Future Performance**

ROKU continues to grow extremely quickly, and the stock should continue to benefit from increased revenues & profits, as well as from multiple expansion.

## **10- Year Risk**

Warren Buffett likes to ask whether a company in 10 years might have revenues and profits that are not substantially increased from where they are today. In ROKU's case, the risk of this outcome is essentially zero -- even if users stopped growing tomorrow and never resumed, ARPU growth alone could carry the business. As a profitable company, there is no risk to ROKU the company should the capital markets dry up in a big way (though this would of course hurt the stock).

## **Competitive Landscape**

ROKU reports having the #1 market share in the US & Canada, as well as growing market share in its new international markets -- Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom & France Expansion to new geographies in Europe & Lat/Am is on the immediate horizon. 

ROKU describes its international strategy as ""doing what worked in the US, but in other countries."" Indeed, this does seem to be working.

## **The Setup**

Back in 2020, ROKU came to be seen as a ""pandemic stock"" -- a company that benefited greatly from one-time factors experienced during the corona pandemic. So for 2021, the comps were tough, and the stock took a hit. The result is a severe market overreaction -- ROKU grew like a weed prior to the pandemic, it grew like a weed during the pandemic, and, it will grow like a weed after the pandemic. The coronavirus affected annual growth rates and profits in a big way, but it did not affect the intrinsic value in a similar way.

The stock is more than 50% off from its highs, even lower than it traded pre-pandemic, while being the strongest company that it has ever been with no signs of stopping. 

**PT: $4,200**
