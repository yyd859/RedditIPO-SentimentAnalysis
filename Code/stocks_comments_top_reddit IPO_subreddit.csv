Right, Facebook collects data, I don't dispute that. How they *use* that data is what's important.

>and stating that the raw data isn't sold directly is splitting hairs

The distinction is actually very important. Most people think that Facebook freely sells user data to other advertisers, which is bad in part because it carries certain privacy implications with it. That's a major reason that people dislike Facebook (and other big tech companies that run ads), and it's not even true.

>we didn't ask for these targeted ads

You asked for them by continuing to use free products and services. Gmail, YouTube, Google search, etc. are all free because of advertising. As unpopular as ads are, I think most people would greatly prefer them over the alternative, which is paying for everything out of pocket.
