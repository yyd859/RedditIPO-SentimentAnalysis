It's all hosted on the harddrives of the members of each community (like limewire back in the day).

141,hoscbnb,t1_hosap8j,Genuinely. I caught Reddit decently early (lurked for years before I made a profile) and don‚Äôt want to miss out on the next boat!!,t3_rhjfei,16,unclebens
142,hot3m6t,t1_hosaodt,"Woudn't this kinda have the same effect as onlyfans trying to remove porn had? Basically shooting themselves in the foot?

A lot of people are on redddit precisely because it's one of the few sites around where you can have a community around tabboo topics like drugs and gore imagery (plus a lot of porn, of course). Take that away and we're left with yet another bland site that has the same content every other social media has.",t3_rhjfei,6,unclebens

Who has that dataisbeautiful post handy that had a matrix of all NSFW communities? We‚Äôre talking a serious, sizable chunk of Reddit‚Äôs content.",t3_rhjfei,3,unclebens
145,houe1wi,t1_host36t,"Viral posts can only account for the top 1% or something of total content, that's not really how social media statistics works. Those 100k+ up voted posts you see are the least common denominator of society. Where there is diversity, there is apparently reason for censorship due to ""challenging the status quo"". Especially relevant for porn, especially relevant for this sub. 

If you've ever read the book 1984, you should be really concerned with your comments on the least common denominator being satisfied. That's not where we live our lives.",t3_rhjfei,1,unclebens

Okay if I share this folder with some newbie grower friends?",t3_rhjfei,4,unclebens

152,hosv6vn,t1_hosfccp,"Same here. For me it's less about growing tips and more about interaction and helping people. I can tell you that if it does happen and we know when, that last day I'll be offering prints for free. What are they going to do at that point, ban me?",t3_rhjfei,6,unclebens
153,hosl89q,t1_hoscbnb,I just hope a large population of users collectively choose a platform so it doesn't splinter off into 20 different shitty forums with low engagement. This def sucks!,t3_rhjfei,14,unclebens

155,hot1eyz,t1_hosqo3w,"I appreciate it, and I get where you are coming from. I should care more, but I now get emails from travel reservations for a scientist in Australia cause he has the same chat and last name.
