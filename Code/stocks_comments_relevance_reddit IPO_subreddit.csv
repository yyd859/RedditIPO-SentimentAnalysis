I also worry that subreddits will become even more shilled than they are now.  Imagine being in r/movies and a lot of the reviews are from paid sources/influencers.  Bad reviews could get removed or shadow-banned to please a paying sponsor.  Etc.

94,hpq72l0,t1_hpq1fj6,">every single ""survey,"" every single ""one like equals ...."" on facebook was generated to collect and mine a user's personal interests as this ""raw data"" you say wasn't sold.

Right, Facebook collects data, I don't dispute that. How they *use* that data is what's important.

>and stating that the raw data isn't sold directly is splitting hairs

The distinction is actually very important. Most people think that Facebook freely sells user data to other advertisers, which is bad in part because it carries certain privacy implications with it. That's a major reason that people dislike Facebook (and other big tech companies that run ads), and it's not even true.

>we didn't ask for these targeted ads

You asked for them by continuing to use free products and services. Gmail, YouTube, Google search, etc. are all free because of advertising. As unpopular as ads are, I think most people would greatly prefer them over the alternative, which is paying for everything out of pocket. ""YouTube Premium"" is practically a joke because no one wants to pay for it, but then everyone still complains about the ads. But you can't have it both ways.",t3_rho3z0,1,stocks

- If you leave your company, you will need to choose whether to exercise your vested options when you leave — because the company isn’t public yet there will be greater uncertainty around their ultimate value and you might have to wait a while before being able to cash out. 

Here’s [a site with basic info on ISOs](https://carta.com/blog/what-are-incentive-stock-options/). You could look at sites like Crunchbase to get a better sense of your company’s funding history and it’s current valuation, which might help to give a sense of potential future valuation growth.",t3_rlhfes,3,stocks
197,hpfsbra,t1_hpfpmco,"Okay that makes sense. I read that an option represents 100 individual stocks. Would the math be as follows?

(IPO price - $12.77) x 100 x the number of options",t3_rlhfes,3,stocks
198,hplt5dx,t1_hpfsywv,Thank you for this information,t3_rlhfes,1,stocks
199,hpftrkh,t1_hpfsbra,"No.  The 1 option contract is for 100 shares refers to publicly traded options, not employee options.

You should also verify what type of option you are being offered.  ISOs and NQ options have very different tax treatment, as do the RSUs often offered by companies that are already public.",t3_rlhfes,5,stocks
200,hphjn2c,t1_hpfsbra,Stock options granted as part of employee compensation are very different then publicly traded options contracts.  Only similarity is the word option.,t3_rlhfes,2,stocks
201,hpghjqf,t3_rll0xo,I have done a couple of IPOS normally the fee works around 7% and maybe towards 9-10% if options are attached. Very worthwhile,t3_rll0xo,3,stocks
202,hpgfahb,t3_rll0xo,"Underwriting spreads. Depends on syndicate form. But usually it's around $1-$2 per share. So if a company has an offering around $15 per share for 10,000,000 shares to raise $150,000,000, the underwriter could receive 10 or 15 million.",t3_rll0xo,1,stocks
203,hpgk9w1,t3_rll0xo,"Underwriting costs are approx. 7% of the IPO value. Additionally, there are greenshoe-options (the underwriter can purchase shares at a negotiated price and sell them before the IPO, if there are to many investors interested)",t3_rll0xo,1,stocks
204,hpgjzg7,t1_hpghjqf,"So could 1 potentially estimate a best-case earnings by finding 7/9-10% of each IPO valuation? If I calculate that, I'm coming out to a total of ~$163 million, which is higher than their 2020 earnings. Up until October however, the IPO transactions do seem to be relatively far between, which makes me think they may legitimately pull an insane earnings report when March rolls around.",t3_rll0xo,2,stocks
205,hpgfzaj,t1_hpgfahb,"Wow, that's very profitable! I assume this isn't pure profit though, there will probably be fees associated with the IPO process that will eat into the total profit.",t3_rll0xo,1,stocks
206,hpgqogb,t1_hpgjzg7,"  Very plausible, that why good IPOs are so sought after. Only if their is a lot of competition the commission might be a lesser amount or amount to more options than hard cash.",t3_rll0xo,1,stocks

209,hozslza,t3_ris5lh,"Oh Reddit will find ways to monetize, but it will probably lead to the eventual downfall of the site. 

As for myself, if they pull the plug on 3rd party apps I'm 100% gone. They are probably looking into that so they can force everyone to the official app and juice up the advertising.",t3_ris5lh,3,stocks
