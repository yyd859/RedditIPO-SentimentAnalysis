0,Reddit to go public with a valuation over $15 billion?,9,rinwjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/IPO/comments/rinwjj/reddit_to_go_public_with_a_valuation_over_15/,5,1639766460.0,Reddit has filed confidential paperwork with the securities and exchange commission to IPO and go public. Sources have told Reuters that the company is aiming for a valuation above $15 billion which will be interesting to see if/when reddit goes public.  Redditâ€™s valuation doubled to $6 in February as a result of wallstreetbets and the gamestop and amc short squeezes. In August the company was valued at $10 billion in a private fundraising round.  Opinions on the IPO tend to believe that the company will join other tech companies in trading at a premium due to rapidly growing revenues. Given wallstreetbets crazy antics I will be interested to see what will happen on the day of a prospective IPO. I made a video on this topic which can be viewed [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GdIrOhaHY)
