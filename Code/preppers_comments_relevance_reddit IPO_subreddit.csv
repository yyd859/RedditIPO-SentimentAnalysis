Reddit will undoubtedly change with new management. These changes may push away quality users or bring in unsavory ones. 

We've already seen objections to current social media platforms spurring politically charged new platforms. There are several. 

We end up with separate echo chambers and the division gets worse.

Tornados rolled through our area last Saturday morning and we were without power for 3 days.  Now, to be honest, we just went to a hotel and ate out, but if this had been a winter weather situation where that wasn't possible, we would have been fine.  We have food, water, a fireplace, multiple ways to cook, and generator capacity to keep the fridge running for many days.  The advice in this sub has definitely impacted the choices on what we've elected to buy and store.

Bitcoin *alone* is estimated to be using 13GW of power (today, 2021-12-17 @ 18:25 GMT). To put that into context the entirety of the UK demand (which will include some bitcoin power) is 43GW right now during peak demand as everyone cooks dinner in the dark winter nights.

Do you *really* think that is a good use of energy, or do you think some other mechanism could be found?

Oh, one last thing. Don't forget that the powers given above are end user powers and don't include the inefficiency of generation and distribution. Take a low carbon modern nuclear power plant like Hinkley C. It will generate about 3.2GWe, but it will piss away 6GW of heat into the sea. Closed cycle gas turbines are better. A 3.2GWe plant would chuck about 2.2GW into the atmosphere. What about renewable? Well, in 2020 the UK produced 75TWh of wind energy from 11,000 wind turbines.
