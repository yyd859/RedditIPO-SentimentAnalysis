1,hozx9ul,t3_riulem,"One of my favorite exchanges on that thread:

A: I‚Äôve seen the Reddit Boglehead forum and have seen questionable ‚Äúadvice‚Äù with recommendations for growth tilts, sector funds and let‚Äôs not forget the 100% equity portfolio.

B: How is that any different from here (*meaning the Bogleheads forum*)? Seriously....

A: On this forum we debate it and back it up with factual information. Reddit Bogleheads for the limited exception of a few regulars I‚Äôve seen on there push their opinions without substantiation.

So when Bogleheads have a discussion, it's ""debate it and back it up with factual information"". When Redditors have a discussion, it's ""push their opinions without substantiation"". Even if they say the same thing.",t3_riulem,96,Bogleheads

> The r/Bogleheads subreddit has more registered members than this forum does (120,000 to 113,000). I don't know what members here are picturing when someone says ""Reddit"", but I think they would be pleasantly surprised to see it's pretty much just like it is here. The sub has a guiding principal just like here: *""What is a 'Boglehead' Anyway?! While it means different things to different people, the 'Bogleheads' (or: passive indexing) approach to investing is all about low-cost, tax-efficient, broadly diversified, long-term simplicity. This philosophy is about making a plan for the long haul and sticking with your strategy through times of fear or irrational exuberance. Set and forget your nest egg, tune out the noise; buy, hold and rebalance; get outside, enjoy life!""*

Fun fact: I wrote up that description of what it means to be a Boglehead. Being a slight web nerd, I tried to stack it with keywords so that people searching for things like 'indexing' and 'simplicity' and 'strategy' would wind up here ;)

> They have links to this forum, a dozen or so articles on this webpage including the Bogleheads Philosophy and the wiki; a link to the Wikipedia page for Jack Bogle himself; a link to Taylor's book on Amazon; etc etc etc. Their avatar is a picture of Bogle. They even have a pinned link to the ""Why did my fund suddenly drop in value?"" sticky!!

This is all followed by approximately 95% of the sub calmly explaining why they're misguided, how to approach their investments differently, and why, often converting them to full indexing (again, this was my journey).

I remember being one of the last people at my school to get an invite for Facebook (back when that was invite only) and then inviting other people I met on different forums, haha.

I'm sure as a tech professional, you may also appreciate the simplicity of the forum (notwithstanding that their forum probably doesn't have a Tapatalk plugin). I think it's a breath of fresh air, honestly, with all the heavy front-end ""modern web"" we have nowadays. Of course, we don't want to forget mentioning that it requires less data to deliver over mobile networks.

Just offering another perspective. I do agree that the UI could be structured better but I disagree it is *impossible* to navigate.",t3_riulem,2,Bogleheads

I imagine they criticize due to lack of experience, based on time spent on Earth in adulthood. That is, knowledge and wisdom that can often only be obtained through experience and time.

It's not that they believe they are born with a gift or knowledge, but that they have ""done their time"" and earned their knowledge through experience and lessons learned.

I'm not defending or agreeing either way. I just think this is more likely that your take on it. Everyone older than you doesn't think they were born with a gift that makes them better than you. :-)",t3_riulem,13,Bogleheads

But if you have a specific question or fear, ask it here or at Bogleheads.org.   It‚Äôs true that maximum capital appreciation can be attained by holding 100 percent equities.  It‚Äôs also true that the younger you are you should hold more equities.  But, as you get older and depending on the size of your resources compared to your actual needs and ones risk tolerance levels, bonds could play a very useful role.  It‚Äôs one thing to have $20 million in equities when you only have an annual need for $100,000, it‚Äôs something totally different when you have $2 million and you need $100,000.  A market like 1929-1932 can wipe you out if you were all equities.  The biggest losses come when everyone is running for the exits at the same exact time.",t3_riulem,2,Bogleheads
