0,hq38aex,t3_rp4hcn,"Alright, I'm going to step in here on behalf of the mod team.

Reddit has been very supportive of r/antiwork and we have maintained good communication with the admins.  We have even been given access to certain tools and features not made available to other subreddits.  We have no reason to believe at this time that the announcement of a forthcoming IPO will lead to major changes in Reddit policy or to any sort of activist shareholder(s) engaging in conspiratorial plots to have this subreddit or other leftist subreddits shut down.

Most of the subreddits that have been banned have been banned either due to being unmoderated, or for persistent, pervasive, unmoderated violations of the Reddit Rules.  We have consistently taken steps to abide by the Reddit Rules, to the best of our interpretation.  If the admins point out to us that we need to take further action to abide by sitewide rules, we will take appropriate action.

We do not need a massive panic to making alternative servers or trying to jump ship from the subreddit.  While we are floored by the fact that so many of you are eager to make contingency plans, the moderators here want to ensure you that we do not foresee any forthcoming subreddit ban or other adverse action taken against the subreddit.  If and when that changes, we will make an announcement to that effect.",t3_rp4hcn,1,antiwork

There is quite literally no point to listening to what the admins will say in statements. 

Because the reality is they have no idea.  Every single acquisition begins with the promise that the IP being sold will retain its independence.  The rank and file will be told whatever they need to be told so that they can push the message downstream and keep everything peaceful and stable prior to the IPO.  They'll lie, knowingly or unknowingly, for no other reason than because great sums of money are at stake.

But once the chains are in place, the changes begin insidiously and persistently.  And no one at the company has any power to change that, even if they wanted to.

Large and powerful labor organizations are ""bad"" for ""business"".  And when a company IPOs, ""business"" is literally the *only* thing that matters.

The fiduciary obligation of a company to its shareholders includes endeavoring to profit. It doesn’t consider the health of the community or well being of its product end user or any other externality / community stakeholder except to the extent it is calculated to make them look bad in the public view (and sometimes- only sometimes to the extent to which it’s required to by law / regulation / the EPA). 

All the more problematic when you have one party actively trying to tear down regulation so they can have a runaway growth engine, even if it kills people and permanently damages communities. If corps didn’t at least endeavor to profit, the board would be ousted. 

It’s been a problem for decades and is the reason why you see corporations doing things like dumping toxic effluent into rivers and killing people downstream while literally paying millions a day in fees to the EPA and then paying out class action suits for rare cancers (Dow, BASF, Exxon, pretty much all of cancer alley, and that’s just a single example). They employ teams of accountants to protect their bottom line / shareholder value and they factor in the cost of the legal fight for causing harm. 

While this is a dramatic example since not every corp is manufacturing something that creates toxic waste products, without adequate regulation we can’t expect publicly traded corps to behave as good-faith contributors to the community. They will only do as much to save face / give back as they feel maximizes their bottom line, to the detriment of the lowest paid workers, people in communities where these monsters pollute-for-profits, etc.

Agreed that labor will always be necessary, but completely self chosen in my own antiwork ideology. As someone who loves stepping up to the plate I don't buy into ""who would do it then?!"" comments.

IMO the way the OP describes his working overtime and feeling burnt out after only 3 months, it still sounds like wage slavery/the kind of work we already have; not really the labor I envision us achieving...
