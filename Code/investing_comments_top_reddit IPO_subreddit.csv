**1)** Please direct all **advice requests and general beginner questions to the [daily discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/about/sticky?num=2) threads.** This includes beginner questions and portfolio help.

**2)** Please understand the [rules and guidelines for commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/wiki/index/rules).

**3) Important: We have strict on-topic rules. No political, religious, and non-investing related posts or comments (including Covid health policy discussions which are not directly investment related). Political posting guidelines** (described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cyee69/formal_posting_guidelines_for_political_topics/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/escewo/temporary_rule_change_what_happens_to_stocks_if/)). Violations will result in a likely 60 day ban upon **first instance.**

**4)** This is an open forum but we expect you to conduct yourself like an adult. Disagree, argue, criticize, but **no personal attacks.**

7,horiyu0,t3_rhjgq9,"I think Reddit has an excellent business model with just the right ratio of adverts, to free content, to enticement to go premium.  
  
This company is quite difficult to value and while they will show impressive growth numbers, you know some meme-hype will be factored into the price.  
  
Depending on the price, this is an easy buy to boom not because Redditors will buy the stock but because Wall St will think Redditors have the power to take it to the moon.",t3_rhjgq9,-7,investing

I don't think they could ever come to terms on pay, I remember some mod writing that his work is worth 120k a year or something. That's probably 2-3x the industry standard for filtering content violations.",t3_rhjgq9,3,investing
