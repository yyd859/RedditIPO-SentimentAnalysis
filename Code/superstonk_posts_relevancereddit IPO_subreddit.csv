0,Once reddit IPO's I want to reimplement it.

We will create a blockchain-based ""reddit clone"" as open source together. This will be the biggest Ape migration ever (your karma will be kept).

One man can't do it alone though.  I am not interested in the ownership of the clone either. It would be best if there was no owner at all. All I want free and censorship free communication, truth and nothing but the truth.

We will need:

* Software developers
* blockchain experts
* project managers
* graphic designers
* translators
* lawyers
* managers/CEO
* etc...

**The work will be voluntary, no salary will be paid**. I thought after the MAOSS this will not be necessary for you.

So if you want to be part of it, if you think you can help, post here. If Reddit is so insane and decides to IPO, we will get started.

I thought only a couple would response. Now look at this. How can the HFs even dream of a chance to win?

This spirit is insane. Thank you guys for the support.

**EDIT#2: Blockchain-Based?? WTF?**

There seems to be confusion as to what was meant by Blockchain-Based.

Here are a few keywords:

* Decentralization (main feature)
* developers and hackers are not able to get the (private) user data. It is at least extremely difficult.
* It is impossible for a hacker to manipulate contributions afterwards
* It is impossible for a person (hacker) to exclude or disenfranchise a user. community has that under its control. (remember why we already have two sub migrations behind us?)
* Example: Loopring donation instead of award."

Then they'll hire some black market hacker to hack and delete the few DD repositories that's not on reddit, like that DD library someone made.

as you probably already know, [Reddit is planning to go public](https://www.printfriendly.com/p/g/diZuHM).  This could have some reeaally bad consequences for apes if we keep  relying on this platform. This post is to propose a plan, should another  exodus become neccessary.

# 1.: Reddit now

One important thing only few know is who runs Reddit right now. It doesn't use its own servers nor AWS but it's [hosted by Fastly](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/numerous-popular-websites-are-facing-an-outage/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9ndWNlLnRlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHX_4WKhAVe4ARbG_EcIgfS0PbYATBgbBKHuuTKxuJzkiK7zDxFHOB-Lin_CHqluVO07PcnBZICRO97gQuJD-PpFNo15Pyhgl0uu98oXdq4vLhH57gDVnXpkyIN2fakDMusYK0Srdiw_FKdYi43hgc9R3AyHHwt4J0ww25p6KuIL).  Fastly is a service specialized demanding, high-performance hosting and  also provides the servers for other popular services like Pinterest and  Spotify. This means, those are the computers where all our written DD,  all posts, all memes, all fake internet points are stored - and also all  meta data. So whoever controls those servers has access to all user and  traffic data you ever generated on this site - through tracking  services potentially elsewhere, too.

So who is Fastly? The board of directors delivers the first interesting find: [Paula Loop](https://www.theofficialboard.de/biografie/paula-loop-09g87)! She currently holds three director positions:

* PwC US: fair enough
* Fastly: That's how we found her
* **Robinhood: Lo and behold!**

First red flag.

Next step, who owns Fastly? [There is some interesting stuff in there, too](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLY/holders?p=FSLY).

[The usual suspects](https://preview.redd.it/3zx8vpz0wy581.jpg?width=897&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b02022ac6e4fc4b6004550fe81f689c3f2367b2)

Second red flag.

So  we're essentially feeding all our DD to Robinhood, Susquehanna and  Blackrock, right? And we're expecting them to provide the main service  we rely on to communicate. Right. I don't know about you but I don't  need more evidence to see the need for a more secure platform for our  community.

# 2.: Where to?

Color  me weirdo but I think it's not a good idea to go from one commercial,  hedge fund infested platform to another. It should be open source and  decentralized. The most sophisticated and secure platform that functions  like Reddit is [Aether](https://getaether.net/).  There already exist communities for the popular GME related subreddits.  They are mostly inactive right now but still, if a migration should be  necessary, there they are.

Aether  is not a website but decentralized and works P2P - a bit like a  blockchain or Torrents but not really one of those. To access it, you  need to install a dedicated client, create a user and that's it. The  dedicated client provides more security, privacy and transparency than  your general browser and spares you a few clicks if you use a computer.  It doesn't get more secure than that. It's currently available for  Windows, Linux and Mac and an Android App is in the works.

I'm  quite stoked for that network, it's just quite empty for now. But in  case of another exodus, it provides the best options for a new home.

# 3.: Keep calm and carry on

Please  don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting an exodus. This is just to raise  awareness to the dangers on our current platform for serious topics  like MOASS, crimes of the elites or a revolution of the financial  system. People already received death threats and law suits so an  additional layer of security seems quite nice - just in case.

But  until then, there is no immediate need for action. Just, please keep  that in mind. There is a dedicated platform existing that provides the  exact functions we are looking for, there is absolutely no need to go to  YouTube comment sections and wrestle with completely unfit UI.

**TL/DR: Reddit is already quite bad and will very likely become worse for us.** [**Aether**](https://aether.app/) **is the best solution, should another exodus become neccessary.**"

Reddit will not be the same. Its goal now is to provide a platform that engages users while offering up ads for revenue. They have expanded to buying awards, coins, ad-free experience, etc... but when they become public, they will focus primarily on revenue vs the social development of the business. That's just the way the world currently works, unfortunately. 

There is hope, however! I logged on to another social media platform the other day, after months of ignoring it, and discovered that they are shutting down their platform due to lack of developers, funding, and time. It is an open-source platform and they recently published the full code on their Github under the MIT license for anyone to continue where they left off!

I'm not advocating for a mass migration or anything like that, but...! This group has \~700k people here. Many would be capable of developing the platform further and, if the same kind of atmosphere could be kept, it may provide an option in the future. Funding wouldn't likely be an issue based off of what I've seen this past year either. 

The full codebase is here [https://github.com/OkunaOrg](https://github.com/OkunaOrg) and their primary website is/was [https://okuna.io/](https://okuna.io/).

Here are the parting words of the founder as well, if you're interested. [https://lifenautjoe.medium.com/the-end-of-an-era-marks-the-beginning-of-a-new-one-798afa85c120](https://lifenautjoe.medium.com/the-end-of-an-era-marks-the-beginning-of-a-new-one-798afa85c120)

The iOS, Android, and web platforms are all in working and easily usable condition, so not much would be needed to take it and start it back up under a different name. And being FOSS, it's definitely a promising alternative to anything that's out there currently.

With control over Reddit, it would be possible for them to start spreading mass FUD and shill attacks.

Imagine:

You see your favorite DD author accounts start posting articles that slowly but surely start to deviate from what we've been learning all along.

You think to yourself, you trust the DD, and this author never led you astray, and the changes start so small that you don't even realize they're happening. But is it really the author that is saying these things?

Many other users also are agreeing it seems, who's this anon? Oh he has XXXXX karma? And their history is only SS, GME, LRC? He MUST be legit, I can trust this ""ape"". And on and on it goes.. but is it a REAL account? Remember, they now have complete control over account generation...

Sentiment changes, it spreads throughout the sub (the 50monkeys rule) and what has been worked up to all this time boiling to a point, simmers and pressure is released.

THIS is the real damage. Not the closing of the sub. 

The ultimate FUD and shill attack.

I realize that this post itself can definitely be seen as FUD, and I'm not denying it.

But for the pot to boil over, we must keep the fire burning.

Phone numbers, and European ones at that... That's my floor.

I'm hoping (because I'm not smart enough) that wrinkly apes can figure out a new place for the apes.

We migrated before from wallstreet-bets, to GME, to SS/Jungle, and we're not afraid to do it again.

We're nomads. The fight goes on."

Many of us primarily only get our information from upvoted posts on ""hot"" or ""DD flair"" on this sub or others like it. If the SHF, or others that are against us, can disrupt our flow of valuable information, that would be a powerful tool to use against us. Who knows, this may never come to fruition, but we need to come up with a way to pass on vital information just in case. I'm not entirely sure a way for us to avoid this. I know we have Gangum Style, but that doesn't seem like the best alternative method.

Y'all feel free to discuss below and maybe we can come up with something together.

""We're in the endgame now.""  As I have stated before, the clock is ticking, and the clock is not in our favor.  As many of us like to use the word 'zen' as if it justifies inaction, I beg to differ.

Many a great youtuber have been in agreeance on one thing: that shills and infiltrators, inside our open/free forums, are making every attempt to prevent MOASS while engaging in psychological warfare and issuing propaganda.  These shills and infiltrators are actually funded by the same entities who got caught red-handed in their illegal practice of destroying hundreds of American companies by shorting them to death, and while funding the media to force a false sentiment upon the masses.  We know these hedge funds are backed by their brokers, and who brazenly circumnavigate securities laws and financial regulations.  J.P. Morgan and Chase Co just admitted to guilt in their violation of securities laws.  Note: this news was released on a friday (the day where PR teams release news when they want to hide something or minimize their reputational harm).  Also read about Goldman Sachs fraud during the Great Recession, the $600B bailout, and how often the SEC (effectively dirty cops) accept hundred-million dollar deals in lieu of real justice.  Let us be crystal clear: you rarely, if ever, see any of these crooks behind bars where they belong.  They write a check instead.

But this writeup is not meant to become a sob story; I am no gadfly.  I want to discuss Reddit's IPO.

We know that Reddit, and its merit-based and open forum for discourse, was the root cause for January 2021.  Reddit allowed for Keith Gill, who is by fact a bold violator of FINRA regulations himself, to advocate for his stock.  GameStop was his all-in bet, and he advocated for over a year for his position (there were moments when that bet was not going well for him).  Yet, Warren Buffett does the same thing.  ""Advocating for your position"" is one of the long-standing rules of successful investing.  (why do you think Warren in his prime bought out so many news companies?)  Although YouTube and other forums were also used, Reddit allowed for a truthful discourse.  Free humans engaging in discussion, sharing of open information.  Yet, in terms of sentiment (which is the source of financial decision making) Reddit is the 'sentiment casino' itself.  Hedge Funds quickly want to become the Dealers in that casino.  As we know, the casino also wins.  After all, they design the games and their odds of winning.

Yet, on the same day that J.P. Morgan was caught ($200M fine), they issue a 'distraction' all over CNBC?  The distraction to their financial crimes was about short selling.  Why?  Well, because the Department of Justice and SEC are busy right now, as they have stated that there is an active CRIMINAL investigation into short-selling practices, specifically.  Essentially, J.P. Morgan being a broker for Melvin Capital (legal Target) quickly went from Group of Interest to Subject.  They paid a lot of money to avoid prosecution on Friday.  Notice, however, that J.P. Morgan jumped on the news to issue propaganda about their take: that a short squeeze is inevitable now, through Christmas, and into year-end.  Because Federal prosecutors were criminally interviewing J.P. Morgan all week, they likely 'jumped ship' onto the good side and, on the same day of the $200M penalty, spoke in favor (all of a sudden) of a short squeeze.  This is why I believe that there will be no fake squeeze, and instead the one squeeze will simply be MOASS.

Reddit Leadership, on the other hand, has been the sole entity in this saga (and very innocent, mind you) who was not attempting to profit.  Apes (mostly low class, some middle class, and few upper class) want MOASS.  That's profit (advocating for their position). Brokers and Hedge Funds (all upper class and connected with the ruling elite) don't want MOASS (shills advocating for their position).  But, as we spoke about before, the medium for advocating for your position is the real money-maker.  In Warren Buffett's day, it was the newspaper companies.  Today, it's the internet.  For investing, though, Reddit just became the ultimate newspaper company for top investors to try to advocate from. Hedge funds and brokers, therefore, know that this is their only and last chance to infiltrate the source - Reddit - in order for them to try to prevent MOASS.  For these reasons, combined with the fact that FUDelity's $400M was one of the largest and earliest funding in their pre-IPO rounds, I believe Reddit Leadership was solicited.  I believe that Reddit Leadership probably did not want to go public, but that their company became what will forever be known as the battleground for the largest sentiment war for the largest potential transfer of wealth to other societal classes in human history.

And they may have just sold us out for their own gain.  And what is the other problem with this?  Any funds that us Apes use in the quest to buy 51% of Reddit right now are funds not going into GameStop.

With all of this stated, I like the idea of the real MOASS occurring right now, while the prosecution of the Federal Government onto the criminal hedge funds and criminal brokers is clearly so actively hot.  

TLDR;  Reddit Leadership wants to profit from the Apes vs Hedge Fund 'Tug of War.'  Maybe they just wisened up to this spontaneously, or maybe they were given an offer they couldn't refuse?  Reddit is effectively the 'sentiment casino', so who will become the Dealers?  But, the Reddit IPO just became a new financial battleground in the hedge funds' latest, we're-in-the-endgame-now-level distraction to GME.  Thus, only after MOASS occurs, and Ken Griffin is in jail, we can then (and only then) consider diversifying slightly from our GME positions and into the modern day newspaper companies like Reddit, where we can forever-ensure fairness and equal opportunity in the sharing of free, public information."

Whatever stories they propagate, data they share, fud they print, bots and shills they deploy, or subreddits they destroy are as worthless as the USD is about to become. There is literally nothing they can say or do that will change my mind. Nothing they say or do will keep me from diamond handing GME in CS and buying more whenever I can.

**Quick Note from a Crayon Eatin' Dick Puncher**

Hello Apes - u/happy_dick_punch here. You might know me from my previous hits around glitches, shitposting memes, dropping some music covers, kicking around the banter or just eating some crayons round here.

Long story short, I‚Äôve also got a background in digital. Been having some good discussions this past week related to the Reddit IPO stuff, backups, preserving, archiving and then considering the future. I own [gmeforever.com](http://gmeforever.com/) and offered that as a space if we want to think about utilizing it as a future house for whatever.

Ok, This post is about archiving all the folks who are talking and volunteering and want to consider collaborating. Putting this list together so you apes can have a place of reference to find, connect, engage, volunteer and hopefully keep things rolling. Lots of talented little silverback brains in here.

Been seeing and involved in a few discussions over the past week around building backups of our beloved home here on r/SuperStonk and preserving the archives while also considering how we might move forward in the future.

There have been great discussions and talking with people and seeing all the amazing talent.

I scraped a bunch of posts, comments and people who raised their hands to put together a list for organizing and archiving everyone who wants to be involved in various little projects, etc around digital, data, development, design, etc.

Below are some posts I have scraped with usernames.
